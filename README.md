Competition: Stock Finance
Given the close proximity of the 2024 USA presidential elections, stock markets are
ripe with volatility! Traders are placing their bets on which companies they wish to keep in
their portfolios that will have the highest ROI. With that said, traders are banding together
on social media to share their ideas on which stocks are “going to the moon”. Your job, in
this competition, is to assess the overall sentiment of the portfolio of stocks below by
leveraging any datasets you deem necessary. Disclaimer: this is not financial advice to
trade these securities.
Stocks : [$ONCO, $CNEY, $TNXP, $APLD, $KTTA]

Your goal is to leverage publicly available data/APIs to build a time-series dataset (most
recent date as of September 26th, 2024) with factors that can be used to accurately predict
stock price movements, encompassing sentiment-based data. We expect that you will
leverage social media data/APIs as part of your submission.
Given that this is a prediction-based task, we would expect some form of Machine Learning
to be incorporated into your submission. To simplify the target variable, we ask that you
use a binary classifier (1/0) that denotes whether there was a price increase (1) or not (0)
from the previous trading day. As for model validation, you are free to use any metric you
deem important to assess the accuracy of your Machine Learning model(s).
