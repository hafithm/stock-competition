Share my view and watchlist on mpox(monkeypox) investment.,9,19,2024-08-26,"**Investment Thesis :**  
MPOX is getting more serious. While there is some speculation that mpox could be the next covid, its lethality is actually significantly higher than coronavirus. According to recent data, the case fatality rate for mpox can range from 3-6% in endemic countries, which is much higher than COVID-19's estimated global fatality rate of around 1%. Given the recent outbreaks in Europe., we believe there are a number of near-term upside events for stocks of various sizes that already have relevant products or are in clinical trials.

Am I crazy or is TNXP a decent gamble at current price? ,25,51,2024-08-23,"**TL/DR:** *I am relying on ‚ÄúTonix submits NDA for TNX-102‚Äù news by December ‚Äò24 to confidently believe you will profit on this stock (if you bought this year). Tonix has never been this close to generating sales and commercializing a product. Tonix has been reliable/consistently delivers on the progress of TNX-102, which is the product that will save the company.*

.

DD is for Tonix Pharmaceuticals. Ticker TNXP. I hold 8,000 shares at $0.64 

TNX-102 is their only shot of making money anytime soon. 

Plan to submit NDA for TNX-102 by EOY. 

The average amount of new drugs being approved per year is 55. This year we are at 30. Also, TNXP is Fast Tracked, and it‚Äôs been reported that **~75%** of Fast Tracked drugs get approved. 

If approved, TNX-102 will go to market. Tonix does everything in-house and already markets 2 drugs. They have no cash flow, but minimal debt and the experience to market drugs. Also, the investors post-approval will give them plenty $$. New drugs on market earn an average of **$18B** their first year in revenue. 

Current MC is 8M. 

Current EV is 13M

P/E is .29 

P/S is .05

P/B is .17

TNXP is trading **83%** below its book value. The worst is factored in and this company‚Äôs stock reflects a bankrupt firm. If they get TNX102 approved, it will absolutely explode. 

.

Why isn‚Äôt the price rising? Here‚Äôs what I think:

-Fear of Tonix delaying NDA submission

-Fear of NDA not getting approved 

-Dilution 

-Fear of further possible reverse splits 

-Short Interest 

Shorting is minimal concern at this point, given the current price and the timeline (4 months/EOY) for a huge catalyst (NDA submission). 

TNXP is NASDAQ compliant until February 2025. No need for a RS if they submit their NDA by EOY like they have been promising. 

Regarding the cash problem, since Tonix‚Äô timeline to submit NDA is so near (EOY‚Äô24), they can‚Äôt dig their hole much deeper, as investor money will pour in after submission/approval. Tonix received **$36M** in total funding from **US Dept. of Defense** and **US Dept. of Health** for TNX102‚Äì imagine the financial support after it‚Äôs submitted/approved. These next few months are make or break. 

There may be another public offering between now and Feb‚Äô25, at which point the stock will dilute and drop further. But at this point, IMO, any buy-in at these prices will still reward monstrous returns, if TNX102 is approved. You can chose to wait for another offering, but it may be too late. 

Now the hottest topic, **dilution**. Tonix is an At-the-Market company, which means they can buy and sell shares without filing. Any gains until NDA submission/approval will likely fall back, as Tonix needs money desperately. I think NDA submission/approval will remove the need for dilution, due to the monumental increase in buying. **TNXP will continue to fall after gains until Tonix has enough cash to finish Phase III, submit NDA and commercialize TNX102. What stock price this happens and stops at is up to you to decide.**

.

The chance to profit from TNXP in the event that Tonix submits an NDA‚Äîafter constantly stating they are on track for 2H‚Äô24 and pre-NDA meetings were a success‚Äîis certainly worth the gamble. 

The Fast Track program makes approval decision **<2 months** after submission, instead of 6-12 months, so the timeline for drug approval is Feb 2025 at the latest. Keep in mind, many large buys may happen after submission since Fast Track shows 75% approval rate. Plan accordingly. 

.

**My personal take/plan**: TNXP will rocket after news of NDA submission and will not fall lower than the price before the news (due to the 75% approval chance). It will drop from the company taking profit, but diluting will cease by Q2 ‚Äò25 (with effects less impactful leading up to), due to receiving enough investment capital/grants once TNX102 is submitted/approved. The submission news will likely drop before November (Earnings are 11/7). It could be tomorrow, it could be later in the year, but now is a good time to buy. I‚Äôm going to take some profits after submission news then monitor for the next 60 days leading up to FDA approval to try and get a stable long position. I‚Äôm expecting **insane** volatility during the 60 days of post-submission / pre-approval. TNXP will likely stabilize after approval. 

.

All in all, it comes down to TNXP sticking to their EOY word. TNX102 already has 2 Phase III studies completed, which is what‚Äôs required for submission. Their current stages of TNX102 align with their EOY NDA submission goal. 

Tonix has never dropped the ball on their TNX102 timeline: every earnings report since 2021 provided TNX102 updates and subsequent ER followed through with previous TNX102 plans *(e.g. ‚Äú102 phase III starting soon‚Ä¶ 102 Phase III started‚Ä¶ 102 pre NDA meeting in Q2‚Ä¶ pre NDA meeting happened and was a success..‚Äù*. Why do we think this consistency will change with their commitment to submit 102 NDA by EOY? 

Look out for NDA submission in 4 months. If TNX102 is approved, the deep value of TNXP will come to light and make the sky the limit.",/r/pennystocks/comments/1ezgm52/am_i_crazy_or_is_tnxp_a_decent_gamble_at_current/,-0.34,0.0,0.179,0.821

**Coya Therapeutics (Nasdaq:COYA) @ $6.06**  
Coya is a biotech involved in three (3) significant disease areas...ALS (Lou Gehrig's), Dementia and Parkinson's. With¬†over $40 Million in cash on hand, COYA has the runway to announce clinical data in the Second Half, 2024, like Phase 2 trials for ALS expected before the end of the year. Coya's focus is on the inflammation of the nervous system, which is involved in many high cost maladies beyond ALS, Parkinson's and dementia/Alzheimer's ie. Huntington's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).¬†Based on¬†2¬†Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for¬†Coya Therapeutics, Inc.¬†in the last¬†3 months. The average price target is¬†$16.50¬†with a high forecast of¬†$18.00¬†and¬†**a low forecast of¬†$15.00**

**Tonix Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq:TNXP) @ $0.69**  
At $0.69, TNXP is purely a technical play with the prospect of positive fundamental news in the Third Quarter. TNXP has done a reverse split AND two capital raises over the past three weeks. The short interest has, not surprisingly , exploded. But the Company has interesting upcoming clinical data milestones pending and the capital to avoid no need for future dilution for the next 18 months. TNXP is worthy of a look by nimble traders reasonably¬†**expecting a rebound to over $1.00**, given the VERY low public float and prospects for more clinical data.

**Dragonfly Energy Holdings (Nasdaq: DFLI) @ $0.85**  
Battery storage and rapid charging speeds is the focus of DFLI and its¬†lithium battery cell production.¬† Dragonfly Energy's patented dry electrode manufacturing process can deliver chemistry-agnostic power solutions for a broad spectrum of applications, including energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics. With a 52 week high of $3.23, DFLI has introduced proprietary products geared to off-the-grid applications in recreational vehicles etc. A¬†~high volume~¬†close ABOVE $1.02 would signal a technical breakout.Based on¬†4¬†Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for¬†Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp¬†in the last¬†3 months. The average price target is¬†$1.49¬†with a high forecast of¬†$1.75¬†and a low forecast of¬†$1.20. The average price target represents a¬†76.14%¬†change from the last price of¬†$0.85.

Red Cat,¬†a drone technology company integrating robotic hardware and software for military, government, and commercial operations is join the Russell Microcap¬Æ Index at the conclusion of the 2024 Russell US Indexes annual reconstitution, effective following the closing of US equity markets on Friday, June 28, 2024.

All four of these stocks are near their 52 week lows with very low Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the charts. For those new to using technical analysis for trading, a RSI under 30 is considered ""Oversold"" and ripe for a trading bounce. No guarantee here, because each company's investment story is different. But doing basic due diligence on stocks with very low RSI's can be a good starting point.

These stocks have clearly been under pressure--which often attracts **short sellers. As traders know, short squeezes can develop when the downward trend stops and reverses.**

**$TNXP--Tonix Pharmaceuticals** ($1.15) went through a 1 for 32 reverse split and raised $4 million in capital. **With a VERY LOW RSI of 13** and a very low public float, this biotech may be one to watch for a bounce. The Company expects to submit a New Drug Application (NDA)¬† for the treatment of depression in fibromyalgia patients--before the end of the year. Prospects for more news from clinical trial progress is high over the next three months.

**$AMLX-- Amylyx Pharmaceuticals** ($1.64) is involved in the research and development of treatments for neuro-degenerative diseases (ie. ALS, Alzheimer's etc.) which has had some disappointment on revenues and clinical trial results. The Company has made it clear that **they have the ""cash runway"" into the year 2026** with milestones in their development programs.Technical traders will note the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 29.

**$NAAS--NaaS Technology** ($5.73) is the first¬†U.S.¬†listed EV charging service company in¬†China. Its 1 for 20 reverse split was not welcomed by the market, but the stock will remain listed on Nasdaq.¬†China's EV sales continue to rise with low cost Chinese EV's capturing more market share. NAAS looks oversold here at a RSI of 26.

**$MAXN--Maxeon** **Solar Technologies** ($1.35) produces solar panels and energy solutions for residential, commercial and power plant customers. The problem here is the US tariffs on China-produced solar panels. But for traders, there may be a bounce this week as the bad news on revenues has been digested by the market and new buyers initiate their positions.¬† MAXN recently announced that Field testing showed that new Maxeon solar cells had a 70% lower average temperature rise in partial shading compared to competing technologies, providing an economic reason to pay the tariffs.¬† RSI is at 39.",/r/pennystocks/comments/1dh9jen/time_for_a_bounce_tnxp_amlx_naas_maxn_with_low/,0.2732,0.196,0.129,0.675

On a purely technical basis, the LODE, SISI and TNXP charts should be watched for breakouts based on substantially higher trading volume on Friday vs. average trading volume. All three charts look to have put in a base after selling off from much higher prices. 

Comstock (LODE) average trading volume was 820K, but in Friday's trading the volume spiked to 3.2 million. Presto Automation (PRST) went from an average day's trading of 4.5 million share to over 8.6 million shares. Tonix Pharmaceuticals (TNXP) had almost a 300% increase in trading volume.

PRST was up 31% on Friday, whereas LODE was up only 16% and TNXP increased 8%.¬†

Finding a stock BEFORE they go up big is much better than ""finding"" a big mover AFTER it moved.¬†¬†$SISI hit the volume scans today and was up 19% on roughly double the average daily trading volume on Friday--and is now up another 40% in After Hours.
