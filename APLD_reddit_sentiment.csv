**they invented and have proven the tech.**

#####They said the satellite would not unfold. 
*“The size of the antenna is terrifying… there’s only a handful of entities that have deployed a foldable thing in space that big and they’re NASA and intelligence entities… it’s an extremely difficult thing to do and it’s also more or less impossible to accurately test on the ground.”* (Former Director of Engineering at SpaceX - Kerrisdale report 2022)

**legs spread wide with no issues.**


#####They said it was too big and thin to be structurally stable in orbit. 
*“The problem with AST SpaceMobile is the structural dynamics of their spacecraft – the way they intend to build a giant phased array antenna is really poorly thought out… their knowledge of structural dynamics is so positively infantile; I don’t know how they got as far as they did. I think their approach to making a giant antenna just won’t work. I think even if you could talk directly to a handset from space, they wouldn’t be able to do it.”* (Physicist and Former Senior Engineer, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Kerrisdale report 2022)

**The satellite is #solid as a rock#**


#####They said the panels would overheat with no appropriate cooling solution 
*“When I look at this AST spacecraft, I don’t see this as a spacecraft that is going to function well because it’s going to start overheating… so you can’t have it on for very long and so at that point, what are you proving?”* (Former Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer, OneWeb - Kerrisdale report 2022)

-The KOOK Report ([Full 172 page up-to-date DD found here](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp))

- **Financing it's constellation** - they are rapidly nearing ""too big to fail"" status. Their tech is needed and desperately wanted by deep pockets which will not allow it to fail.
- **U.S. regulatory approval** - U.S. Department of Defence has [already paid ASTS $500k](https://irp.cdn-website.com/1fadf91c/files/uploaded/Q1_2024_Earnings_Press_Release_vFinal.pdf) to run tests using their single current test satellite. The military wants this tech YESTERDAY. There's no way the US government will allow regulators to cockblock their own military. They already have the positive enthusiasm of the FCC behind them. This is pretty much a given, and IMO just a matter of time.
- **Finilasing it's commercial agreements** - They have already begun finalising commercial agreements with [AT&T](https://about.att.com/story/2024/ast-spacemobile-commercial-agreement.html) and [Verizon](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/ast-spacemobile-verizon-satellite-internet.html) 

The AT&T and Verizon definitive deals are HUGE.

>*""Also with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum. The way cellphones currently work they can’t carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum. And so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds. No one else comes close.""*

#####and Lynk @ 43million subscribers

Not that Spacemobile need these extra subscribers, but I foresee that it won't be long before even those few MNOs abandon the SoS text messaging ship in favour of ASTS' broadband offering. Why would they choose to travel by horse while everyone else is driving cars??

Something these ""competitors"" all have in common is that the service they provide is trash in comparison to Spacemobile. Most of them are self proclaimed SOS emergency text messaging services when deployed. 

The Apple service applies to iPhone 14 and above, is outdoor SOS service, and you need to use an app that shows you which direction in the sky you need to point your phone toward in order for it to work lol...

#####Why aren't AST Spacemobile known?
You're not their target customer - MNOs are. Partners like AT&T are the target for ASTS, and you're the target for AT&T. No advertising overheads for Spacemobile, just lines of cocaine with MNO C-suite shotcallers in luxury suites. The way ASTS have long been speculated to have structured their deals with early investors is a straight 50/50 split. So once they send their satellites up to space, they just need to maintain them until de-orbit. Nothing but profit while the MNOs advertise and sell the service to you - as seen [here in the recent AT&T commercial starring Ben Stiller and featuring an ASTS satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYm3BaIonv0&ab_channel=AT%26T). 

Their initial test results surpassed all of their own expectations. So much so in fact, that they revised the number of satellites required for global coverage, reducing their costs in the 100s of millions.

You don't need the latest iphone for this. This isn't just SoS text messaging. This is full broadband connectivity from space, no extra chips, antennas, or satellite dishes needed. Out in the woods? middle of the desert? camping in the mountains? drifting in the ocean? You're connected. Gone are the days where movies rely on their characters having no phone signal for their plot to work. This isn't just so you can browse Insta while on a cruise and avoid paying $30/day for their on-board internet. This will bring affordable access to everyone globally. Some kid in Somalia now has access to an education which leads to them discovering the cure for cancer. Poverty stricken teenagers around the world can rip the head off it streaming deep fakes of Zendaya getting railed in full HD. This will change the world.

There are 400 million people which live in areas with no internet infrastructure AT ALL - forget moving in and out of coverage. Let's say they're the poorest places that the service is provided to and therefore coverage for them will be priced at ~$2/month with ASTS getting half. Let's say only half of those 400 million opt in to the service, so $1 x 200million. Let's go with the BASIC 5x valuation. That's $2.4billion/year x 5 = $12billion company valuation, giving a share price of $48. That's considering a cheap service reaching the wallets of half the population of the areas with no coverage at all, so a pretty bleak scenario.

Typical wsb responses

#####""But SpaceX has thousands of satellites more than ASTS""

-_____- ...

#####""But SpaceX has unlimited money, they can catch up in no time""

ASTS has patents and patent claims in the thousands which solve issues SpaceX is still stuck on or hasn't even thought of yet. SpaceX have even applied to lower the altitude of their satellites to solve some of their major issues around beam forming, and the FCC told them to go fuck themselves, it will never happen. By contrast, go take a look at Jessica Rosenworcels (Chairwoman of the FCC) excitement to approving the framework ASTS would rely upon in the March 2024 hearing. [Around 1:12:00 for the cream.](https://www.fcc.gov/march-2024-open-commission-meeting)

#####""So? with their funds they will eventually solve these issues and catch up""

Even if they did, they don't have MNO partners that control spectrum to meaningfully transmit over.

#####""SpaceX can just buy them out""

Abel Avellan, CEO and founder of AST Spacemobile holds ~84% of the controlling shares. He was founder and CEO of a satellite company called Emerging Markets Communications (EMC) until he sold it for a cool $550million in 2016, and then founded Spacemobile the following year. He went in to this venture after making enough for generational wealth, he could have kicked back and relaxed, but he didn't. He's not looking to sell, he's looking to create a legacy. He knows what this is worth, and even 10x the current market cap wouldn't cut it. To date, there hasn't been a single insider that has sold shares. Not one share.

#####""But zoom out on the graph, the company is going down! It always drops after a run""

The initial spike doesn't really count for anything, that's just SPAC merger rush. All the other dips are from delays and dilutions. Some of which could not be helped, and some of which were just bad management decisions, such as great news followed by news of dilution in the same day. A lot of the delays from suppliers have now been remedied by moving a lot of their fabricating and manufacturing in-house, with the added bonus of cutting down costs. Dilution will hopefully be warded off now as more MOUs become definitive agreements and funding. There are multiple upcoming catalysts for this stock, and after each one there will be a new bottom, we're rapidly approaching a turning point where the company begins generating meaningful regular revenue.

#####""But SpaceX SpaceX SpaceX""

The Starlink offering was touted as [17mbps, with a 15% packet loss](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1764032892663906313?lang=en), and the numbers were recorded 2/3rd of the way up to it's final altitude orbit, so who knows what the actual figures are... what we do know is that you need at least 5mbps to stream 1080p video and yet [here is the video quality Starlink demonstrated 3 weeks ago](https://x.com/spacex/status/1792981845296160791?s=46&t=vg6hLz-68IK28GznXUCu2g) - and you can forget expecting even this pixelated garbage when they launch the service, because this supposed ""17mbps"" is PER BEAM shared across many users in a large area. To his credit, Elon does somewhat set expectations, but the praise expressed in the X responses makes it clear that his followers only consume the headline. [18:00 in.](https://youtu.be/Qzli-Ww26Qs?t=1080)


Now compare it to ASTS' demo [streaming the AT&T commercial while their test satellite, Bluewalker 3, flew over a remote region of Hawaii on a rainy night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5HBu3-I-A4&ab_channel=ASTSpaceMobile)

and also compare it to ASTS and their 4 way video call using a 14mbps 4G connection over 8 months ago. 2:00 in to their video titled ""First-Ever 5G Connectivity from Space to Everyday Smartphones Achieved by AST SpaceMobile"" on the same youtube channel as the above post.I can't link it because the link contains 3 consecutive characters of a stock you're not allowed to post about...)

#####""I never see these posts till the run has happened""

Currently at +249% for the month - this is not the run. This stock sits at ~$8 right now, the last time it was $16 they had just announced that their test satellite was on the way to the launchpad. They have 5 more sats set for launch Q3 this year. I believe we will see $20+ this year easy. This is NOT the run - the run is 8000% ""long term"". Duetsch Bank have given this a 2027 price target of $672. Given Spacemobiles track record with staying on schedule, I'm inclined to be pessimistic about the timeline, but I have no doubt $672 is possible. That's just $81billion market cap. Annual revenue of 10-16billion per year would be fair value for that share price, and is easily achievable for Spacemobile once full constellation is up. (Edit: miscalculated, $672 would be a $174billion market cap, would need annual revenue of around ~$20billion)

**Latest speculation:**

Earlier this month, [AT&T announced their definitive agreement with ASTS. As part of this deal, their Head Of Network - Chris Sambar, was to join the ASTS board of directors](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/att-ast-spacemobile-tie-up-provide-space-based-broadband-network-2024-05-15/). Days after this announcement, Verizon announced their own definitive agreement with ASTS. These two events were the catalyst for the 300% jump we saw this past month. Earlier today, it was announced that former Chief Technology Officer of Vodafone, [Johan Wibergh joined the ASTS board of directors](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604977331/en/AST-SpaceMobile-Welcomes-Telecom-Industry-Veteran-Johan-Wibergh-to-Board-of-Directors). Not only is he just a valuable asset to have, but he is also on the board of directors for Bell Canada. In the last few days Bell Canada also happens to have found it's way to the front of the [Strategic Partners page on the ASTS website](https://ast-science.com/company/strategic-partners/) where they display just 6 - 8 entries even though they have much more. Prior to Johan joining, Bell Canada were not featured there. Will we see the pattern continue and expect a Bell Canada or Vodafone definitive agreement in the comiing days? [More discussion around this speculation can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1d742ey/strategic_partners_webpage_updated_theory/).

But you can ignore reading the tea leaves about Johan Wibergh and just count on other impending solid catalysts highlighted by CatSE---ApeX---'s [recent post on WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d3m8ew/posted_this_here_5_days_ago_got_6_likes_up_116/), each of which will give the SP a nice bump 

I've been invested in this company pre-spac merger and have lost a significant amount on short dated options and even leaps expiring worthless - so I wouldn't recommend option plays... I know long term holds aren't the typical WSB play, but it's extremely rare to discover companies like this where you have the opportunity to get in at the ground level, and make similar gains from holding these shares, that you dream of making with Option yolos.

30k YOLO Lets Get it!,173,174,2024-05-19,"**Bull Thesis on $MARA: A Comprehensive Analysis**

Hey everyone, I want to share my bull thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA). This analysis is divided into two parts: fundamentals and technicals. Let’s dive in!

**Fundamentals**

1. **Strong Earnings Potential**:
   * **Estimated EPS**: Based on Q1 earnings of $1.3 per share, the trailing twelve months (TTM) EPS is estimated to be at least $4 per share.
   * **Current Valuation**: With a current share price around $20, this gives $MARA a Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio of 5.
   * **Potential Upside**: If investors apply the S&P 500’s minimum PE ratio of 15, this suggests a minimum potential price of $60 by the end of the year (EOY).
2. **Bitcoin Holdings and Mining Power**:
   * **Bitcoin Holdings**: $MARA holds 18,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, which provides significant asset backing.
   * **Mining Capacity**: The company currently has around 30 EH/s (exahashes per second) of mining power, with a target of increasing this to 50 EH/s by EOY. This expansion is expected to boost revenue and profitability.

**Technicals**

1. **Weekly Chart Analysis**:
   * **5-Year Time Frame**: The stock is close to breaking out of a cup and handle formation with a neckline at $27.
   * **Profit Target**: The projected profit target from this breakout is $50.
2. **Daily Chart Analysis**:
   * **Year-to-Date (YTD) Performance**: On the daily chart, the stock appears to be forming a triple bottom with a neckline at $21.
   * **Profit Target**: The profit target from this pattern aligns with the cup and handle neckline at $27.
   * **Support and Risk Management**: The current price is around $19.50, which acts as a support level. This is a good point for setting a stop-loss to manage risk.

**Catalysts**

* **Bitcoin Price Movement**: A key catalyst is Bitcoin breaking the $70,000  mark (which is also its long term cup and handle neckline) , which would likely drive $MARA’s stock price higher.
* **Mining Reports**: Monthly mining reports showcasing increased production and efficiency will bolster investor confidence in the company’s performance targets.

**Historical Accuracy**

As some of you might remember, I was bullish on $MARA last December when it was trading around $20, predicting it would reach $30—and it did! You can check my post history for verification [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17oeiij/comment/k8lsrfx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17oeiij/comment/k8lsrfx/)

**Timing**

Historically, $MARA tends to perform well in summer and winter. Therefore, I'm targeting the first week of June as my first profit point at $27 (I want to avoid trading the second week of June for the CPI and FOMC meeting) and then the first week of  July as my last  potential sell time at $35-$40, capitalizing on this cyclical pattern. Then anything below closing $19 as a sell out zone to manage my risk.

**Conclusion**

For me, this is an easy trade given the strong fundamentals and promising technical setup. I believe $MARA has significant upside potential, especially with the catalysts on the horizon.

What are your thoughts on $MARA? Do you see any additional catalysts or risks that I might have missed? Let’s discuss!

The Great Wall and Wall Street: Become a Better Trader by Understanding the Perils of 🇨🇳 Chinese Companies on 🇺🇸 U.S. Exchanges,106,69,2024-05-13,"⚠️ *Attention all traders and holders of Chinese stocks:*  
*You should read this if you don’t know what a VIE is. Sure, most of you will be repelled by the great wall of text here (so many words!), but you might want to keep this post nearby.*



Hello.  
You are aware that Wall Street’s bustling bazaar hosts a veritable Forbidden City of Chinese companies draped in ticker tape rather than silk.  
Today, I will provide background and data on all allowed Chinese companies listed on three of the largest U.S. stock exchanges: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and NYSE American.

I should note that a bustling troupe of 26 national securities exchanges are registered with the SEC in the United States. Most are owned by the Nasdaq, NYSE, or the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

Nonetheless, based on data from the [World Federation of Exchanges](https://www.world-exchanges.org) as of August 2023, the NYSE and Nasdaq were the top two exchanges behemoths of the global financial stage, accounting for 42.4% of the total $110.2 trillion in valuation traded across 80 major global exchanges.



🖼️ I had a photo of Wall Street to add here, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



**2022 vs. 2023**

According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, as of January 8, 2024, there were 265 Chinese companies listed on the three U.S. exchanges, with a total market capitalization of $848 billion.  
That valuation is down from a year prior—January 9, 2023—when a slightly lower 252 Chinese companies were tracked, but they represented a total market capitalization of $1.03 trillion.

Since January 2023, 24 Chinese companies have entered the spotlight of the three U.S. exchanges, raising $656 million in combined initial public offerings (IPOs). On the other hand, eleven Chinese companies have folded their tents and delisted.



**China Securities Regulatory Commission**

The American stock exchanges witnessed a springtime bloom of Chinese IPOs in the first quarter of 2023. However, this listing activity came to an abrupt halt as the clock struck March 31, 2023.

Why?  
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) [implemented a revised approval process](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/china-publishes-offshore-listing-rules-2023-02-17/) for companies going public overseas.

I won’t get into the details, but China has rules to cap foreign investment and ownership in sectors deemed strategic, such as technology.  
In the past, those regulations have driven several Chinese firms to the legal gymnastics of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure—a clever contrivance that allowed them to leapfrog domestic constraints.

However, under the revised review mechanism, every company, regardless of its corporate ownership structure, must now bow before the [China Securities Regulatory Commission](http://www.csrc.gov.cn/csrc_en/index.shtml) (CSRC) to register its intent to list overseas.



🖼️ I had a photo of the CSRC building to add here, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



**The gatekeeper**

Therefore, although the CSRC touted this regulation as a necessary measure for enforcing regulatory compliance and preventing fraud (which is true), it also helps regulators act as gatekeepers poised to block any proposed listing they deem poses a risk to their national security or jeopardizes China's national interests.

This process is wide-ranging. For instance, it includes an evaluation of the company’s safeguards against disclosing what the Chinese Communist Party considers potential state secrets.  
But we’re not talking about top-secret black-ops projects meant to be hidden from international oversight committees. No… any company that collects personal information on more than one million users requires stern data security review mechanisms for its cross-border data flows.

For perspective, TikTok has over 150 million users in the U.S. alone and is not subject to the same scrutiny from the Western nations.

Currently, the CSRC approval process is reportedly taking upward of six months.



**Audit inspections and investigations in China**

You’re probably unaware of the HFCAA, so let’s start there.

The [Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act of 2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/945/text) (HFCAA) is a law that requires companies publicly listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. to disclose to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) information on foreign jurisdictions that prevent the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from conducting inspections.

That law laid down a stern ultimatum:  
If Chinese authorities kept obstructing the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) from inspecting audit firms in China or Hong Kong for three consecutive years, the companies audited by these entities would face a ban from the bustling arenas of the U.S. exchanges.

Basically, either China allowed the PCAOB to inspect the audit firms, or the companies had to change to another auditing firm within three years.

Then, as 2022 waned to its final days (literally, on December 29), President Joe Biden signed a [Consolidated Appropriations Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617/text), which contained a provision that will tighten the noose, shortening future timelines from three consecutive years to only two.



**Once they looked under the rock**

Finally allowed to conduct full investigations of audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong after over a decade of obstruction, the PCAOB announced the findings of its first round of inspections in May 2023, identifying deficiencies in seven of eight audits conducted by the auditing firms KPMG Huazhen and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Hong Kong. [Audits of Chinese Companies Are Highly Deficient, U.S. Regulator Says](https://www.wsj.com/articles/audits-of-chinese-companies-are-highly-deficient-u-s-regulator-says-2da99766)

On November 30, 2023, the [PCAOB announced fines](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/imposing-7-9-million-in-total-fines-pcaob-sanctions-three-china-based-firms-and-four-individuals-in-historic-settlements) against three audit firms in China, totaling $7.9 million for misconduct. For perspective, that number included the second and third-largest fines ever doled out by the PCAOB.

Why were the fines so bad?



**Those sneaky Chinese accountants**

Imagine a gaggle of accountants in the far reaches of PwC China and Hong Kong applying for a U.S. auditing curriculum. But alas, these foreign accountants find the U.S. auditing training tests a trifle tedious, so someone came up with the answers and decided to pass them around like a secret note in a schoolroom.

From 2018 to 2020, over 1,000 of these busy bees completed their U.S. auditing online exams by copying the answers from two unauthorized apps with a fervor that would make a gossip columnist blush.

When confronted with the evidence, PwC China and PwC Hong Kong response: 🤷‍♂️

And let me remind you, this happened late last year.  
Both firms are expected to provide reasonable assurance that their personnel will act with integrity in connection with internal training and to report their compliance to the PCAOB within 150 days—April 2024.



🖼️ I was planning on using an AI-generated image of Chinese accountants cheating, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



**State-owned enterprises**

According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, this graph represents the total market capitalization of Chinese companies listed in the three U.S. exchanges.



[Market Capitalization of Listed Chinese Companies](https://preview.redd.it/e8m49xhhh90d1.png?width=2310&format=png&auto=webp&s=204c57b6b9f085aec53fd055753cfb2ee86a6035)



The number of listed companies has stayed at around 260.  
However, all Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have delisted themselves from U.S. exchanges, most of them soon after the PCAOB announced it had secured complete access to Chinese auditors’ records.



**Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)**

Most traders—and that means you—are unaware that 166 Chinese companies currently listed on the three major U.S. exchanges use a VIE structure.

As of January 8, 2024, these companies have a market capitalization of $772 billion.  
For perspective, that represents **91%** of the total market capitalization of all the Chinese firms listed on the three major U.S. exchanges.



**What the hell is a VIE?**

It is a complex corporate structure that grants shareholders contractual claims to control via an offshore shell company without transferring actual ownership in the company.

A Variable Interest Entity (VIE) is a bit like a riverboat casino’s cleverest trick, allowing a company to sell its chips on a foreign table without ever letting the players hold the cards directly.

A VIE is a structure used primarily by companies that wish to partake in the financial streams of another country (the U.S. exchanges) without breaking local laws (Chinese laws) that prevent full ownership.

Remember, Chinese companies structured themselves as VIEs to circumvent China’s restrictions—not U.S. restrictions—on foreign ownership in industries the CCP deems sensitive.

Therefore, when you hold stock in one of these Chinese companies, you’re not officially holding any actual ownership in the company. Because if you did, then that company could be breaking Chinese restrictive caps on foreign investment and ownership.

That’s why they set up a façade, or a legal entity, that controls the business on paper, but the true power and profits are funneled back to the company pulling the strings.

Granted, it’s not as shaky as asking a random stranger to hold your shares, but it is crafty, and you should be aware of the risks.



**Wait. What are the risks?**

You need to understand that there’s a shadow of *potential* risk looming. Potential.  
Now, don't mistake me for the town crier of doom; I'm not proclaiming that the sky is falling on these shares. Nor am I declaring that disaster is certain for Chinese stocks.

What I am pointing out, however, is the presence of a risk—a subtle beast that might just catch you off guard if you remain unaware.

And let’s face it:  
Most of you are completely oblivious to these issues.

There are two sides here: 🇺🇸 & 🇨🇳



🇺🇸

Since July 2021, the SEC has imposed additional disclosure requirements for Chinese companies using a VIE to sell shares in the U.S. These requirements include greater transparency about the relationship between the VIE and its Chinese operating companies.

In summary, the SEC aims to push VIEs toward the company behind them to offer more clarity on U.S. investor ownership in the Chinese operating company.



🇨🇳

On the other side, Chinese companies that list overseas using a VIE were not required to register their listings with the CSRC, as the VIE is not considered a Chinese company under China’s law.  
This is the reason VIEs were used in the first place.

However, as I mentioned earlier, after March 31, 2023, the CSRC established requirements for *all* new Chinese companies to register and receive permission before going public overseas—even those planning to use VIE structures.  
That’s why there was a boom of Chinese IPOs *before* that deadline.

Granted, on September 14, 2023, a Chinese auto insurance platform became the first company that received the elusive blessing of the CSRC to list, and it did so using a VIE arrangement, breaking the long, dry spell that had plagued Chinese IPOs when she listed on the Nasdaq four days later.

However, even though VIEs received some sort of recognition from the CSRC, the VIE corporate structures still hold dubious legal status under China’s laws.  
Remember, VIEs purpose is to avoid being considered a Chinese company under China’s laws.

So… do you see the potential risk here?



**Umm… No, I don’t get it.**

Think about it.  
Either country could potentially increase regulations for VIEs, but if the SEC forces them to be more transparent, the VIE would not be able to circumvent China’s restrictions.  
That’s one risk.

Also, at some point, China’s CSRC might question whether it’s appropriate to recognize a corporate structure that was created to circumvent its laws.

Which leads me to this:  
What’s keeping the CCP from deciding to start reigning in those VIEs?

The answer is simple:  
They’re not in a hurry to do so because if misfortune should befall, it’ll be the foreign investors who’ll see their assets deflated like a punctured balloon.



🖼️ I would've added a nice image or two by now, to balance all the text and make this more appealing, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



If a VIE-listed company goes private at a lower valuation, businesses fail, or there’s a valuation discrepancy, the enforceability of a VIE’s contractual arrangements is unproven in Chinese courts. With VIE-listed companies, foreign investors’ recourse in the Chinese legal system is as elusive as a catfish’s whisper.



**Yeah, but that’s unlikely…**

Sure. Of course, I’m not saying every Chinese stock will have these issues.  
But it can happen. And it has happened.



**The unlucky case of Luckin Coffee**

Due to the lack of compliance with international audit inspections, Chinese corporate financial statements’ reliability for valuation and investment is not assured.

Such is the case of Luckin Coffee.  
In a bold bid to capture Wall Street’s hearts and wallets, Luckin Coffee showed up dressed in finery, flaunting alluring figures of revenue, operations, and bustling customer traffic.

At her grand debut, the stock sashayed onto the Nasdaq at $17, swirling up a storm of interested buyers to the tune of [$561 million in capital](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-ipo/starbucks-china-challenger-luckin-raises-561-million-in-u-s-ipo-idUSKCN1SM2SH/).

For a fleeting moment, Luckin shimmered like a star over the financial firmament, boasting a market capitalization that soared to a heady $12 billion, with shares peaking just over $50.

Ah, but as the adage goes, *‘Truth will out.’*  
And out it came—the revelation of those embroidered numbers caused the company's stock to plummet like a stone tossed from a bridge, leaving a wake of investor losses and culminating in a disgraceful delisting from Nasdaq 13 months after her debut.  
[Luckin Coffee Drops Nasdaq Appeal; Shares to Be Delisted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/luckin-coffee-drops-nasdaq-appeal-shares-to-be-delisted-11593188282)

  
🖼️ I would've added an AI-generated image of a cup of Luckin Coffee jumping from a bridge, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



**Well… but that won’t happen to me…**

Uh-huh. On April 2, 2020, after announcing that employees—including its chief operating officer—falsified 2.2 billion yuan (about $310 million) in sales throughout 2019, Luckin's shares nosedived -80%.

This is from one of you unluckin bastards:  
[I've lost 240k on Luckin Coffee, all my life savings. Now I'm broke af.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gveon3/ive_lost_240k_on_luckin_coffee_all_my_life/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I’m sure many of you might reckon yourselves immune to a similar debacle since you think you’re smart enough to use stops to escape any runaway losses.  
It's time to wake up and smell the Luckin coffee. Chinese news catalysts often strike like lightning at night, and the stops you set under the sun cannot shield you from storms that explode in the moonlight. Dumbass.



**Chinese regulators can be mercurial**

Even though the PCAOB is currently able to perform its oversight responsibilities, concerns remain around the possibility that Chinese regulators might backtrack, potentially clamping down once again on the PCAOB's ability to access audit firms and personnel across mainland China and Hong Kong.

If that happens, the PCAOB can quickly declare a negative determination.  
HOWEVER, this action would only start the countdown under the HFCAA, giving U.S.-listed Chinese companies a window of TWO years to secure services from an auditor in a compliant jurisdiction or face a trading ban. That’s it.

Of course, within that time, Chinese regulators could agree once again to allow access to the PCAOB, thus resetting the two-year countdown without significant consequences.



**What lurks in the shadows**

Although the risk of PCAOB non-compliance looms over these financial engagements, it is the ghost of potentially misconstrued—or, let's say, creatively presented—earnings reports coming to light that should scare you most.  
Or, on the flip side, present the biggest opportunity.

I believe it is possible that there are several ghosts out there—ghastly financial figures dressed up a tad too finely—lingering in the shadows, unchecked and unchallenged.  
If they’re found and unveiled under the harsh spotlight of scrutiny, the fallout would be immediate and severe, leaving investors scrambling.

And if that happens, it’s not about diamond-holding through the plunge since the company might opt (or be forced) to delist from the U.S. exchanges.



🖼️ I would've added an AI-generated image of an attractive young Chinese ghost woman, implying both the allure of Chinese stocks, but also the risk of getting closer. However, I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



You need to understand a crucial concept.  
Many traders believe that if a company messes up, plunges, and gets delisted, it means the company is basically over—dead.  
But that’s not the case here. A delisting does not equal death.

I mean, [Luckin Coffee](https://www.luckincoffee.com) is still out there, alive and kicking.

>16,218 stores and counting, covering 240+ cities across China.

You would think that a company like that would not be able to cheat on its balance sheet.  
Yeah, just like you would think PwC China would notice 1,000 accountants cheated their way through the U.S. auditing curriculum.



🖼️ I would've added an AI-generated image of a Chinese accountant dabbing like a boss for getting his cheated accounting diploma, but I'm only allowed to include one attachment.



So… is it too far-fetched to believe more ghosts might come to light, now that the PCAOB can supervise the numbers?

I mentioned a flip side since you could specialize in tracking everything the PCAOB does.  
If you can get a whiff about increased auditing on a certain company, you might decide to play a short position in anticipation of a potential ghost coming to light.  
Be warned, though, that it’s not as if they tweet out which companies they’re auditing.

If I were to do it, I would research and join whatever digital saloon young Chinese ledger-keepers convene in. Perhaps I’d stumble upon a post by SumYungGuy or another pleading for advice on how to parley with the PCAOB Laowai making a fuss over his figures. The poor lad's in a pickle, you see, since he cheated the exam and doesn’t know squat.



**Methodology**

For the purposes of this table, a company is considered Chinese if:

1. It has been identified as being from the PRC (the People's Republic of China) by the relevant stock exchange;
2. It lists a PRC address as its principal executive office in filings with the SEC; or
3. It has a majority of operations in the PRC, including a company structured offshore but whose value is ultimately tied through a relationship in the PRC.

⚠️ *Some Chinese companies that use offshore corporate entities hide or do not identify their primary Chinese corporate domicile in their listing information. This complicates tracing, making it difficult to guarantee that this list captures all Chinese companies registered offshore.*

I should also point out that this list does not include companies domiciled exclusively in Hong Kong or Macau.

⚠️ *Remember, this list only considers Chinese companies listed on three of the largest U.S. stock exchanges: New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and NYSE American.*

Oh, and btw, this isn’t a list I came up with.  
This info was compiled by the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission](https://www.uscc.gov). It’s their methodology and list.

Since the majority is a VIE, I’ve marked the ones that are *not* registered as a VIE with an asterisk (\*).  
This is determined using the most recent annual report filed with the SEC.  
A company is judged to have a VIE if:

1. It explicitly describes using a VIE to conduct all or part of its business operations in China, or
2. It describes a subsidiary in which it has no direct equity interest but relies on contractual arrangements to exercise control and receive economic benefits from its operations in China.

⚠️ *For companies that have been listed for less than a year, information contained in the company’s most recently updated investment prospectus, as filed with the SEC, is used instead.*



**Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges**

Companies are arranged by the size of their current market capitalization.  
All companies utilize a VIE corporate structure, except those marked with an asterisk (\*).

These are only 51 of the 261 Chinese companies currently listed on the major U.S. exchanges to comply with rule three. I kept the market cap minimum at $750M to allow for some wiggle room.

I mentioned earlier that the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission had 265 tickers, but that was on January 8, 2024. Since then, three companies have been acquired, and the other one has voluntarily delisted.

As you can confirm, the vast majority is structured as a VIE.



I was going to include charts to illustrate how several Chinese stocks—aside from the ones with the biggest market caps—tend to display sudden rallies, followed by after-hours reversals.  
It is important to recognize them, whether you want to capitalize on them, or avoid them entirely.  
But I can't add any more attachments, so...

Besides, it's unlikely that many of you have even read this far without images.

What rescheduling Marijuana means,150,120,2024-05-02,"I think a lot of people fundamentally don't understand how monumental the rescheduling of marijuana is. I'm going to lay it out here for you:

Marijuana is going to be rescheduled from a controlled substance 1 to a 3. You may have heard that this puts in the same schedule as things like Tylenol, but so what, right? Why should I care, short that news! No, and I'll tell you why.

1. Rule 280E. This is the bane of the marijuana industry and is the number one reason why businesses have struggled. It states that any business that touches a schedule 1 drug cannot participate in federal programs or benefit from federal tax breaks. This is why the industry pays 40% + in federal taxes, and a total tax rate being in the 60% range in some states. This law will no longer apply to marijuana! That means a double digit tax break industry wide! That means growth and profits like the industry has never seen.
2. Marijuana businesses will have broader access to regular banking. That means lower rates to borrow. Refinancing debt to lower rates. No more risky cash only businesses. That means growth and profits on a massive scale.
3. Marijuana will now be able to be shipped across state lines in the mail.

All of this together will create a boom for the marijuana industry and stocks. It is hard to overstate the impact of the DEA's decision. When this becomes law, cannabis stocks are going to fly. The valuations of every marijuana stock will go up, and there will be a new floor. There are a lot of FUDsters out there trying to scare retail away from these stocks. You saw them short the heck out of them today. They know what is coming and are trying to bring the stocks down so they can get in themselves.

$VHAI fundamentals are interesting,9,29,2024-03-08,"I got into $VHAI a few days ago hoping that it might be the next $SOUN. But it has since dipped further, and I've now been looking at their fundamentals more. Boy was this interesting.... I've then **cut my losses and taken a short position** instead. I'll try to keep this post factual for reasons that you may be able to imagine, so draw your own conclusions.

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcjoSfDLdk). Here their CEO Brian Podolak (presumably u/vocodia_brian) is making a call with their ""DISA"" digital sales agent. Looks very impressive, right? Now check out the date, it's from two years ago! Man, given this kind of revolutionary technology ***two years ago***, **why haven't they already mooned**? Just that computer voice alone, even without its ability to converse and understand, was an amazing achievement at a time when publicly available LLMs were purely text-based, no? Perhaps this voice even sounds a little *too* human? In any case, the fact that they're still a tiny startup with \~10 employees is baffling to say the least.

So what actually is their AI technology? Let's take a look at [this interview](https://medium.com/authority-magazine/brian-podolak-of-vocodia-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-f1aaa8d2a8fb) with Brian. Here, he says that ""we were searching for AI solutions \[..\], but nothing out there was quite what we needed. So, we decided to build our own from scratch"". But no details are given of how they achieved that. Worse, the bios on Vocodia's website give **no indication of any AI technology background** by Brian or their CTO James Sposato.

They have [one single patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/086055955/publication/US2023132143A1?q=pn%3DUS2023132143A1) about their ""DISA"", but this document again contains **no explanation of how the AI is built**. Instead, there's talk about a database of pre-recorded snippets. So the answers given by the ""AI"" in the video are pre-recorded snippets? Uhm, I hope they're not, because the DISA responds very specifically to what Brian says and this won't apply in other calls.

Finally, let's look at their sales. My research has turned up **no public information about any past or existing clients, even two years after an apparently revolutionary product**. Did I miss something? On Feb 29 (compare this timing with the IPO) [they announced](https://www.autonews.com/retail-tech-press-release/vocodia-holdings-corp-announces-first-phase-service-platform-installation) a deal with ""one of the world's Top 3 automobile resellers"", where ""installation of its humanized AI \[..\] is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2024"". Why not install it already now, and why not tell us who that auto reseller is? There's an ongoing quiet period, but this didn't stop them from announcing the deal without the relevant specifics.

Grindr: 🌈🐻 Salvation,13,70,2023-12-18,"This is my analysis and opinion on Grindr (NYSE:GRND). I have casually followed this stock for several months, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I started researching the company intensely and made it the largest position in my portfolio. Because I have not seen this stock discussed much, I wanted both to share my opinions and invite feedback. I believe Grindr is a deeply undervalued business with substantial growth potential and in this post, I try to lay out my thoughts as to why. Please keep in mind that although I tried my best to carefully research the company, I do not guarantee this DD is 100% free of errors, and I encourage you to do your own research and point out flaws in mine. I have included a number of links at the end as a starting point and embedded several within.

# Brief Overview and History

Grindr was founded in 2009 as a dating and networking app to connect users based on GPS location. Initially targeting gay men, over time the app evolved to become the world's largest LGBTQ+ social network and Grindr currently stands as the premier brand associated with the LGBTQ community. The app was American-owned from its founding until 2016, when it was [majority acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/11/chinese-gaming-firm-buys-60-of-gay-dating-app-grindr-for-93m/) by Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun for $155 million in 2016. At the time, the app had around two million active users and generated \~30 million in revenue yearly. The app remained Chinese-owned until 2020, when the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment forced Beijing Kunlun to divest its ownership back to a U.S.-based company, citing national security reasons. The company was sold to San Vicente Acquisition for $609 million and remained private until November 2022, when the stock went public at a $2.1 billion valuation. Initially the share price surged, closing at $36.50 the first day of trading, before falling down to the $5-$7 range where the stock remained for much of 2023. Currently, G. Raymond Zage, is the largest single investor in Grindr, owning approximately 45% of all shares and on December 08, Zage increased his position by an additional $500,000 shares, which I take as a sign of his confidence in the company. Board chair James Fu Bin Lu, founder of Chegg, owns the second largest position in the stock, approximately 22% of the total shares. Grindr has not yet received any investment or coverage from Wall Street firms or analysts, and during earnings calls it has primarily fielded questions from retail investors.

# New Leadership

In October 2022, shortly before Grindr went public, [George Arison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arison), took over the role of CEO from Jeff Bonforte, who had been leading the company since June of 2020. George Arison is a serial entrepreneur, and an openly gay man, and prior to his position as Grindr CEO he led a number of companies and was a consultant at BCG.

In my opinion, in his one year tenure, Arison has proved an extremely capable businessman and a good leader of the company. From the beginning, in his communications to shareholders, he has clearly articulated a growth algorithm for Grindr and executed on it extremely well. Under Arison's stewardship Grindr has seen a 40% YoY growth in revenue and earnings as of Q3 2023. Within the 2022 Annual report, shareholder letters, and previous four quarterly earnings calls, Arison has consistently emphasized that Grindr is (still) in the very early innings stages of growth and monetization journey and laid out a roadmap for the growth story ahead. I will elaborate more on this in the next section, but needless to say, results so far have been excellent. Arison has demonstrated a committment to running a lean business as well, although for growth stock like Grindr I do not believe expenses are as important a factor as the top line. Notably, Grindr made headlines this September when Arison mandated a return to office for its employees and subsequently lost a substantial portion of its workforce. ([Reddit predictably excoriated Grindr's decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/16dreg6/dating_app_grindr_loses_nearly_half_its_staff/) but he laid out his reasons and work philosophy in [this blog from October 3](https://www.grindr.com/blog/our-philosophy-on-work-and-building-an-exceptional-community-going-forward)). Despite the controversy, I agree with Arison and believe the hybrid model of two days a week in office, three days at home will be beneficial to Grindr, its corporate culture, and ultimately shareholders.

One additional aspect about George Arison I wanted to highlight because I believe it's highly relevant is that he is a married gay man with two kids and an active member of the community that Grindr serves. To dive deeper into his background, you may read a bio of him and his partner in this [2019 NYTimes profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/fashion/weddings/george-arison-and-robert-luo-wanted-love-and-to-live-american-dream.html). I think a strong case can be made that as a member of the LGBT community, George Arison has a deeper understanding of the LGBTQ+ community, its needs, and Grindr's customer base. If you listen to his interviews and read his [LinkedIn posts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgearison/recent-activity/all/), he comes across as very genuine about serving the community. He is certainly more in tune than the previous two CEOs of Grindr, Jeff Bonforte and Scott Chen from when it was owned by San Vicente and Kunlun. (In fact, Chen was so out of touch with the userbase he publicly stated in 2018 that ['Marriage is between one man and one women'](https://www.thepinknews.com/2018/11/30/grindr-scott-chen-marriage/)) All of this to say that, until recently, Grindr has likely been mismanaged because its leadership did not understand its LGBTQ+ userbase. Under its new CEO and Board of Directors [which is 60% LGBTQ+](https://fhoudart.medium.com/the-queerest-board-in-history-that-we-know-of-b817c44d6d71), the first in history, I believe Grindr will be able to make changes to build stronger relationships with the LGBTQ+ community, which will lead to increased brand loyalty and customer retention, and be beneficial to the business and shareholders long-term.

# Growth Story

Moving onto the growth story. Upon joining, Arison stated his intention to transform the business and guide it through a new era of growth. Before I dive into how exactly he plans to do that, I think now is probably the best time to take note of the secular social tailwinds that back Grindr this decade.

As of 2022, there were more than 500 million people worldwide who identify as LGBTQ+. Within the U.S., 7.1% of the adult population, or around 18.4 million adults identify as being LGBTQ+.

The generational gap in LGBT Identification is stark:

* 2.7% of Boomers (1946-1964)
* 3.3% of Gen X (1965-1980)
* 11.2% of Millenials (1980-1996)
* 19.7% of GenZ (1997-2004)

From Gen X to Gen Z, there is a 6x increase in the fraction of the population identifying. Although the data for Gen Alpha is not in yet, the trend is clear and I would expect no less than 20% of that cohort will also identify when they come of age, as LGBTQ acceptance continues to normalize.

The global population of LGBT individuals that Grindr targets is a formidable demographic. They are a group with a population of 540 million, a combined purchasing power of $10.9 trillion, and an annual growth rate of 6.7%. If the global LGBT population were a country, they would be a substantial economic powerhouse and a dominant player on the world stage. They would rank [third in population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population), constitute the world's [third largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)), and would be the [fastest growing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_growth_rate) in the world.

Furthermore, Grindr's userbase is highly lucrative and coveted by advertisers. LGBT individuals tend to be wealthier, more educated, travel more, and spend more money than their heterosexual counterparts. They are also more brand-conscious in general.

Taken together, it is very clear that there is massive value to unlock in this space, and Grindr is well poised to benefit from the rapid expansion of its core market in the coming decade.

I will now explain George Arison's vision for precisely how Grindr will do that.

# Phase 1 - Monetize Core Business

The first phase of Grindr's transformation, still in progress, has been to introduce new features and modernize the platform, with a focus on converting free users into paying ones. Throughout most of Grindr's existence, it operated primarily via an ad-supported revenue model, with only a small fraction of users paying for the app. Under the new ""freemium"" business model, the shift has been to grow revenue by enhancing the app's user experience and developing additional paid offerings that users subscribe to. Three such offerings that launched in 2023 have been have been Grindr Web, Super Boost, and Weeklies. So far, this strategy has been wildly successful and in the last year, management has had to raise revenue forecasts several times. Revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be around $255 million, an increase of 31% compared to FY 2022. Despite the growth thus far, paying user penetration remains at \~7%, around 1/3 that of Tinder's, meaning there is still ample room for 8-10 quarters of continued mid-double digit (\~30-50%) annual revenue growth if management can simply continue to execute on the growth plan. This initial phase of Grindr's growth should be complete by the end of fiscal year 2025, so for investors with a horizon of less than two years, Grindr is a strong shorter-term investment as it executes on its monetization strategy.

# Phase 2 - Make Grindr a Global Brand

Although Grindr is available to download in most countries worldwide, presently, it derives 86.9% of its revenue from North America. The company has substantial opportunities for growth by marketing and targeting its products and services for international users. Alongside Phase 1 of the growth plan to monetize Grindr's core business in the domestic market, the company plans to in the medium term increase its user base and revenues by tapping into international markets too.

The same playbook they are executing in the the U.S. can be applied elsewhere and will enable them to increase revenue, first in the European and South American markets and ultimately in underserved communities, [including the more than 60 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia where being gay is illegal](https://www.grindr.com/blog/grindr-applauds-sen-ben-cardins-push-to-improve-human-rights-in-egypt). The company has made it a priority to bolster the positive social trends that are favorable to the LGBTQ+ community in these markets through social activism, while strengthening the product they offer these markets through localization and targeted marketing to accelerate organic growth.

# Phase 3 - Expand into New Businesses

As was previously mentioned, Grindr is a platform that represents the #1 LGBT brand in the world. There is no close second. Grindr's platform provides a valuable source of data on the preferences and behaviors of the global LGBTQ+ community, which can be used to develop innovative products and services that address their evolving needs. The unique connection that Grindr has with the broader LGBT community also allows it to develop targeted distribution partnerships, products, and services that cater specifically to the demographic and generate new revenue streams. Especially in light of the pullback of major corporations marketing to LGBT due to conservative backlash, *this presents a major opportunity for an LGBT-friendly brand to step in and carve out its own niche.* Despite the fallout this year, the LGBTQ demographic remains highly sought after by advertisers, and Grindr is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the opportunity. On a similar note, the company also expects to be able to enhance the health and profitability of its ad operations over time, making ads more relevant to users and more valuable for advertisers. One of Grindr's multiyear initiatives is to build partnerships and relationships with advertisers and agencies in order to replace its generic, third-party ads ads that have a low click-through rate with directly targeted ads.

Grindr currently operates as a hookup, dating, and social networking app, but George Arison envisions its ultimate destination as becoming the trusted lifestyle brand for the LGBTQ+ community. Already, Grindr has 85% brand awareness in the community, and early trends have already revealed many of its users rely on the location-based features of the app, for example, for safe navigation when traveling as gay individuals and seeking suggestions on where to go and what to do in new cities. There is a signifcant unmet market need for services built specifically for the global LGBTQ community, and once again, Grindr remains uniquely positioned to tap into this market. Although in the past, raising funding has been one of Grindr's challenges and it may continue to be in the future ([although the recent $350 Million Credit Facility announcement is a step in the right direction](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx)), the company has ample opportunity for capital-light partnerships with service providers in travel, media, health care, and finance tailored to the needs of the LGBTQ+ community across the globe. These types of initiatives will allow Grindr to tap into a broader customer base, thereby increasing its total addressable market size.

My belief is that Grindr, under new leadership, is transforming the company into a business with a large future growth story. The company is in a strong position to execute on many of its near term initiatives in the next 1-2 years as well as its multi-year strategy for the decade ahead.

# Comparison to Peers

I cannot emphasize enough how differentiated Grindr is, across several dimensions, from other dating apps. In terms of engagement, Grindr is unparalleled. More than 300 million messages are sent each day on the platform and the average user spends 61 minutes per day on the app.

If that second figure doesn't impress you, here are some other avg daily usage numbers for comparison:

* Tinder: 18 minutes
* Bumble: 14 minutes
* Instagram: 29 minutes
* Snapchat: 28 minutes
* YouTube: 40 minuets
* Tiktok: 56 minutes

As you can see, Grindr's numbers blow every other dating app out of the water. The only social media app that comes even remotely close is Tiktok, which has been called the “crack cocaine of social media”. If Tiktok is crack, then Grindr is heroin. Grindr's remarkable user engagement is the leading reason why I am mighty bullish on management's ability to monetize its userbase. Again, their largest priority this year and for the next 1-2 years (Phase 1 of the Growth Plan) is to build more features that generate value for their users (and for shareholders).

There are several additional advantages that Grindr has over other dating apps, because of its userbase of primarily gay men.

For starters, the intentions of many Grindr users differ from other dating apps. Although it also functions as a dating and social networking app, Grindr is first and foremost a hookup app. Other dating apps like Bumble and Tinder have the fatal flaw in their business model wherein if you are successful at finding a relationship, you stop using the app. In order words, the more successful the product is, the more users leave, and this means that the interests of users will always be at odds with the interests of these companies. By contrast, the better a product Grindr can build, the ""happier"" its users will be. Everyone wins when Grindr creates value.

Additionally, gay men tend to get married later in life. The median age of first marriage for same sex couples is 35 compared to 28 for opposite sex couples. This benefits Grindr in two ways: 1) It means Grindr's customer base has a substantially (\~70%) longer active period than other dating apps and 2) Its users will likely be more willing/capable to pay for services compared to dating apps like Tinder whose userbase tends to consist of broke college students (I'm overgeneralizing about Tinder slightly, but not by much).

Presently, around 7% of Grindr users pay for the app, which is less than half the rate of Tinder (\~18%). I believe that throughout 2024, Grindr's will approach Tinder's user penetration, then in subsequent years surpass it and continue rising. (Keep in mind, the large majority of Grindr's userbase is men, who are 22 times more likely to become paid users of a dating app than women are.) It's hard to predict where the terminal rate will end up, but I think a scenario where it settles at 40-50% or possibly even higher is very plausible. If those numbers seem lofty, note that 71% percent of Amazon users pay for Prime ($14.99 per month) and 40% of Spotify's users pay for Premium ($10.99 per month). With these comparisons, I'm not trying to suggest in any way that Grindr is a peer or competitor to Spotify/Amazon, just illustrating the fact that users are willing to pay for subscriptions when they are offered a valuable service in return. In fact, I believe Grindr's annual revenue per user has the potential to be larger than a service like Spotify's because music streaming services are largely undifferentiated and there is no competitive moat.

Currently, Grindr's lowest pricing tier costs $19.99/month and its highest is $39.99/month. These are ballpark numbers, but given its growth rate in both total users and paying user fraction, it's very plausible that Grindr could have 10 million paying customers just for its core app by 2030, each paying anywhere from $200-$400 a year. This is why I believe management when they say they are in the very very early stages of Grindr's monetization journey. The numbers I laid out are of course all dependent on how competent Grindr leadership is, but I believe they can execute. If the monetization strategy is successful, with Grindr's margins it will be a $30B stock by that time. !RemindMe 6 years.

The last point to bring up about Grindr in relation to its peers is that it has the potential to laterally expand its business in a way that other dating apps cannot. Nobody will ever use Tinder to get in touch with a family planner who specializes in the complex legal and financial challenges that same-sex couples face when adopting. Or finding a surrogate. Nobody's getting on Bumble to find a caregiver who's compassionate towards the unique health needs of members of the LGBTQ community. Nobody is ever going to use Hinge as a trusted LGBTQ-friendly travel hub. This ties back to Phase III of George Arison's growth strategy. As Grindr continues to grow, it can continue to expand beyond its core offering explore new features, products, and services that cater to different needs and preferences of its community. Because Grindr has significant ties to its community and because its userbase is so engaged, this provides an opportunity for the company to expand beyond just a dating app and provide adjacent products and services to the community that it serves.

George Arison has said he envisions Grindr as the ['gay super-app'](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/23/grindr-went-public-7-months-ago-heres-whats-happened-since.html). If he can pull that off, the sky's the limit.

All in all, Grindr truly is in a category of its own, for many reasons, most of which are not even close to being priced in. I believe $GRND's outperformance compared to other publicly traded peers like Tinder ($MTCH) and Bumble ($BMBL) is the market slowly coming to appreciate this fact.

# Financials and Valuation

As I just alluded to, I think Grindr (1.4B m cap) is ridiculously cheap compared to its peers: Bumble (2.9B m cap) and Tinder (9.5B m cap).

How does it look in isolation though?

Grindr's Q3 earnings were arguably their best yet, showing a 40% CAGR revenue growth rate and a 50% adjusted EBITDA CAGR since since 2016. They raised revenue guidance several times this year, and revenue for FY 2023 is expected to be $255M.

Income-wise, the stock had a net loss of 437k in Q3 so it basically broke even. However, in this quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by a large one-off severance payment as a result of Grindr's return to office layoffs and a large interest expense that will be lower in the future. Q2 Net Income was $22.3 Million and Q1 Net Income was ($32.9 Million).

Grindr presently has 347M in debt and 30M in cash on its balance sheet.

I believe one of the largest obstacles holding Grindr back before, and the reason it was trading at a discount, was its debt at a high interest rate. In Q4 of 2022, just the interest expense alone constituted was 37.7% ! of revenue. However, its debt situtation is rapidly improving and will continue to do so as its grows its top line and interest rates normalize. Additionally, on November 29th, [Grindr announced it had refinanced its debt](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Secures-New-350-Million-Credit-Facility/default.aspx) with a new $350M Term Loan A and Revolver facility. This has the effect of reducing net interest expense by \~$17M next year.

I expect Grindr to post breakeven or post a small profit for FY 2023. The company has attained borderline profitability during the challenging fiscal conditions of the last year, and it is in a strong financial position moving foward.

Looking ahead, we already know Grindr has the potential to become extremely profitable in the future, and recent debt refinancing will help to accelerate the timeline. Already, when taking into account the company's reduction in headcount, the decrease in net interest expense with the new terms on the debt, and revenue growth, GRND is trading at a forward P/E of 14 which I believe is extremely cheap for a software company with a 40% revenue growth rate.

Its current revenue multiple of 6x is another indication the stock is undervalued. For comparison, Crowdstrike ($CRWD) and Snowflake ($SNOW), two other tech stocks I follow, also have a 40% revenue growth rate year-over-year and they trade at a 21x revenue multiple. If a similar valuation metric were to be applied to GRND, the market cap would be 5 Billion or $30/share. GRND currently trades at $8.15, with the share price trending up 36% in the last month since earnings, so there's substantial for share price to appreciate in this year and into 2024.

Again, I believe there is a strong case that with just the current numbers alone, and not factoring in future growth, the stock is fairly valued at $30/share or 5B market cap which is my price target for 2024. Long term, with Arison at the helm, I believe GRND could be be one of the great stocks of the decade for the reasons I have outlined in previous sections above.

# Bear Case

No Grindr DD would be complete without the gay bear case. As a young, unproven, and undiversified business Grindr is inherently riskier to invest in than, say, a blue chip like Apple or Microsoft.

One risk is that although Grindr enjoys powerful network effects as the #1 LGBT platform, there are other apps in the space like Archer, Scruff, and Sniffies. It's possible a rival could emerge and outcompete Grindr, but over the last year Grindr's new managment have proven themselves to be highly capable, and they'd have to fumble pretty hard to let go of their economic moat. [George Arison has also made it clear that Grindr will be first to market with incorporating generative AI into the platform.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-14/grindr-lgbtq-dating-app-to-add-ai-wingman-chatbot) It's something to keep an eye out for, but at this time I am not too concerned that a competitor arises to usurp Grindr's position as the lead dating/hookup app for the LGBTQ community. Additionally, the industry is not a winner-take-all market, so several different platforms can coexist at the same time.

It could be argued, and it has been argued, that the online dating app market has been saturated. I don't believe this to be true, either. As I detailed above, there is substantial opporunity to grow total user count and revenue per user. Grindr is still in the very early phases of its monetization journey.

Grindr has a somewhat high debt relative to to its cash position. However, the company is liquid, not in any chance of bankruptcy, and moving forwarded its debt payments will be substantially lowered due to the debt refinancing.

# Conclusion

I have been diligently researching GRND for several weeks. Please also do your own DD as well. This post wound up being longer than what I had originally set out to write, but the more I researched and learned about this stock the more I felt compelled to include. If you made it here to the end, thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts. I've omitted a tl;dr because I don't want anyone who isn't serious enough to spend 15 minutes reading all of what I've written engaging in the comments anyway.

Why Healthcare stocks not popular around?,39,80,2024-09-27,"I am new to stock market subs. What caught my attention is healthcare stocks are rarely discussed. I am surprised because unlike other industries:

* Healthcare companies announce product sales and regional sales numbers
* Healthcare companies clearly state if there is competition or not
* Easier to forecast because both Patent expiry date and pipeline are public information

What I like about healthcare market at large:

* Healthcare is one of three defensive industries according to Morningstar. Others are Utilities and Consumer Defensive. Utilities almost always underperform the market. For Consumer Defensive, there are huge barriers to entry. Bluechips in Beverages or Tobacco are hard to challenge. In bear market I am going to buy Utilities and Consumer Defensive; otherwise I chase Healthcare for defensive stocks and stability in my portfolio.
* The reason I go for healthcare stocks is that they possess protected downside with upside potential. It is hard to quantify the ""upside."" I try to ask healthcare professional friends of mine about the drugs.
* Another reason that I go for HC is its historical performance compared to other costs. I am sure most of you are familiar with Moore's law. Please also check Eroom's Law (that is opposite of Moore's) which applies to healthcare industry.

"AI exuberance masks broad weakness in tech sector, say investors",40,39,2024-09-09,">[https://www.ft.com/content/0b14d871-2d19-46f1-9660-5466301e8066](https://www.ft.com/content/0b14d871-2d19-46f1-9660-5466301e8066)

  
**AI exuberance masks broad weakness in tech sector, say investors** 

Many companies unconnected to artificial intelligence boom are yet to recover from post-pandemic downturn 

Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence masks weakness across most of the technology sector, with many companies “still in a recession” following a slowdown that started in 2022, according to investors and analysis of recent financial reports. 

Massive share price gains for large companies that were predicted to be early beneficiaries of AI, such as Nvidia and Microsoft, helped to erase memories of a dreadful 2022, when the tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite tumbled by almost a third.  

Beneath the surface, however, many tech businesses that do not focus on AI have struggled to regain momentum. 

“When you look at technology outside of AI, there’s not that much happening,” said Tony Kim, head of technology investing in BlackRock’s fundamental equities division. “Many \[sub\]-sectors are still in a recession. The only thing that has been really growing has been AI.” 

More traditional tech areas such as software, IT consulting and the production of electronic equipment for other sectors such as manufacturing and the auto industry have faced difficulties, including weak demand and the hangover from overexpansion and overstocking of inventories during the coronavirus pandemic. Some have also directly suffered from the growth of AI, as customers with limited budgets redirect investment. 

Dustin Moskovitz, the Facebook co-founder who is now chief executive of Asana, last week summed up the situation for many companies as the business software group scaled back its forecasts for the rest of the year. 

“What we’re seeing in tech is still kind of the unwinding of the over-hiring and overspending that we saw at the beginning of the pandemic,” he told analysts. “And then that all couples with what I think is massive uncertainty in the economic environment. And then, also, just with how AI is going to play out.” 

Recent financial reports show the majority of large tech companies have been growing more slowly than in the past, while many smaller ones are actively shrinking. 

Groups in the S&P 500 IT sub-index increased revenues by an average of 6.9 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data, compared with a five-year average of 10 per cent. About three-quarters of companies grew more slowly than their recent average. 

Earnings per share increased by an average of 16 per cent in the past 12 months, down from 21 per cent over the past five years. 

The weakness is more obvious in small cap indices, where there is no boost from megacap groups. In the Russell 2000, technology was the second-worst performing sector in terms of revenue growth in the second quarter, according to data from LSEG. Revenue fell 6.1 per cent year on year, while profits were down 2.8 per cent. 

“Generative AI is masking a cyclical downturn in a lot of other core sectors,” said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at RW Baird. “Everyone is hoping things get better in the next few quarters, though hope is not an investment strategy.” 

Even within subsectors that have been caught up in the AI enthusiasm such as semiconductors, some business lines have been struggling. Brice Hill, chief financial officer at chip equipment supplier Applied Materials, told analysts last month that “we’re seeing particularly strong pull related to AI and data centre computing”, but there were “pockets of weakness in the auto and industrial end-markets”. 

“Everywhere you look on the industrial side it’s similar,” said John Barr, a portfolio manager at Needham Funds who has invested in several semiconductor companies including Applied Materials. “Current growth is not so great, so what we’re looking for are companies that have a stable business and are investing in something new.” Recommended Artificial intelligence Rethinking the AI boom, with Daron Acemoğlu 

Investor exuberance around AI-focused companies has faded since the early summer, leading many commentators to predict a prolonged rotation of investor attention away from Big Tech stocks towards sectors such as financial services and industrials.  

Some tech specialists are hoping for a similar intra-industry rotation from the biggest AI stocks to more unloved corners of the industry. While few companies are predicting the sort of triple-digit growth that Nvidia has reported in recent quarters, there are signs that some of the worst-performing parts of the tech sector are turning a corner. 

“I think we are seeing a stabilisation — things have stopped getting worse in those more macro-sensitive areas, and if rates go down then that will help,” said Tony Wang, portfolio manager for T Rowe Price’s science and technology fund. 

“I feel like the idea that AI is the only thing that is working has been the case for the last two years. I’m not sure it will be the case for the next two.”",/r/stocks/comments/1fcvhdq/ai_exuberance_masks_broad_weakness_in_tech_sector/,-0.4215,0.0,0.237,0.763
Visa debuts a new product designed to make it safer to pay directly from your bank account ,98,46,2024-09-05,"Visa said it plans to launch a dedicated service for bank transfers, skipping credit cards and the traditional direct debit process.

Visa, which alongside Mastercard is one of the world’s largest card networks, said Thursday it plans to launch a dedicated service for account-to-account (A2A) payments in Europe next year.

Users will be able set up direct debits — transactions that take funds directly from your bank account — on merchants’ e-commerce stores with just a few clicks.

Visa said consumers will be able to monitor these payments more easily and raise any issues by clicking a button in their banking app, giving them a similar level of protection to when they use their cards.

The service should help people deal with problems like unauthorized auto-renewals of subscriptions, by making it easier for people to reverse direct debit transactions and get their money back, Visa said. It won’t initially apply its A2A service to things like TV streaming services, gym memberships and food boxes, Visa added, but this is planned for the future.

The product will initially launch in the U.K. in early 2025, with subsequent releases in the Nordic region and elsewhere in Europe later in 2025. 

Direct debit headaches

The problem currently is that when a consumer sets up a payment for things like utility bills or childcare, they need to fill in a direct debit form.

But this offers consumers little control, as they have to share their bank details and personal information, which isn’t secure, and have limited control over the payment amount.

Static direct debits, for example, require advance notice of any changes to the amount taken, meaning you have to either cancel the direct debit and set up a new one or carry out a one-off transfer.

With Visa A2A, consumers will be able to set up variable recurring payments (VRP), a new type of payment that allows people to make and manage recurring payments of varying amounts.

“We want to bring pay-by-bank methods into the 21st century and give consumers choice, peace of mind and a digital experience they know and love,” Mandy Lamb, Visa’s managing director for the U.K. and Ireland, said in a statement Thursday.

“That’s why we are collaborating with UK banks and open banking players, bringing our technology and years of experience in the payments card market to create an open system for A2A payments to thrive.”

Visa’s A2A product relies on a technology called open banking, which requires lenders to provide third-party fintechs with access to consumer banking data.

Open banking has gained popularity over the years, especially in Europe, thanks to regulatory reforms to the banking system.

The technology has enabled new payment services that can link directly to consumers’ bank accounts and authorize payments on their behalf — provided they’ve got permission.

In 2021, Visa acquired Tink, an open banking service, for 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion). The deal came on the heels of an abandoned bid from Visa to buy competing open banking firm Plaid.

Visa’s buyout of Tink was viewed as a way for it to get ahead of the threat from emerging fintechs building products that allow consumers — and merchants — to avoid paying its card transaction fees.

Merchants have long bemoaned Visa and Mastercard’s credit and debit card fees, accusing the companies of inflating so-called interchange fees and barring them from directing people to cheaper alternatives.

In March, the two companies reached a historic $30 billion settlement to reduce their interchange fees — which are taken out of a merchant’s bank account when a shopper uses their card to pay for something.

Visa didn’t share details on how it would monetize its A2A service. By giving merchants the option to bypass cards for payments, there’s a risk that Visa could potentially cannibalize its own card business.

For its part, Visa told CNBC it is and always has been focused on enabling the best ways for people to pay and get paid, whether that’s through a card or non-card transaction.

Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,3308,602,2024-08-13,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

Deep dive into UpWork ($UPWK) - An assymetric opportunity,14,16,2024-08-09,"**1.0 Introduction**

The freelance gig economy is growing rapidly, and UpWork is well-positioned as a **leading platform** in this space. In this post, I will break down why I think this company is an underappreciated gem and why it is poised for long-term success.



I believe three tailwinds must be addressed before we dive into the company’s financials:

**1.1** **Millennial and Gen Z Workforce Preferences**

Younger generations place a high value on work-life balance, flexibility, and autonomy. They prefer to be their bosses, manage their schedules, and choose projects that interest them. Given their tech savviness, the “freelance population” will only increase over time. 

Based on a survey, 31% of the participants between the ages of 18 to 29 have freelanced. This is a much higher percentage compared to the other age groups:

30 to 49 years: 18%

50 to 64 years: 13%

The **workforce in 10 years** will be significantly different than the workforce today. The number of freelancers in the U.S. alone is expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year.

  
**1.2** **Change in the educational** **landscape**

The barrier to becoming a freelancer is low. There are numerous educational institutions and online sources (YouTube, Udacity, Coursera, edX, Pluralsight, etc.), to obtain the digital skills needed. Whether that is graphic design, data analysis, digital marketing, video editing, project management, web development, AI… The list goes on.



**1.3** **Companies can save resources, and be quicker to market**

The traditional recruitment process may take weeks while hiring a freelancer can be done in hours. The counter-argument is - *Well, how can companies be sure that they’ve hired the right person?* Although there are no guarantees, unlike traditional recruitment, every freelancer has public reviews provided by previous clients. In addition, if the right person was not hired for a particular task, “*unhiring****”*** can be done much quicker and without additional costs.

The demand for freelancers by large companies is only going to increase over time. Instead of hiring a full-time employee for a project that takes 70% of the time for a few months, hiring a freelancer will prove to be the best solution. The need will be fulfilled, it will bring cost efficiency and flexibility, and it comes with access to a global talent pool. The number of clients using UpWork as of Q2-2024 stands at **868,000**, and it grows at a rate of 4% per year, comparable with the growth of the number of freelancers (in the U.S.).

In addition, companies can build **a continuous 24/7 work cycle**, by hiring freelancers that operate in different time zones. Projects can progress around the clock, **reducing the time to market.**



**2.0 Competition**

One of the topics that is often asked - *What about its competition?*

Well, let’s take a step back and ask the right question - **Who is UpWork competing with?**

1. **Fiverr** - Although it is perceived as the main competitor, only 5% of the projects on UpWork are <$300, meaning there’s not as much overlap between the two companies as it is commonly thought. UpWork is differentiating as the go-to platform for larger projects and/or long-term job positions.
2. **Recruitment/Staffing agencies** - From Robert Half and Randstad to Pagegroup, these companies are the giants in the recruitment industry. However, the stock prices of the last decade reflect the disappointing revenue growth, which has been below the inflation rate. The ultimate outcome is that **their margins are getting destroyed** which is a clear sign of **the disruption happening at scale**, and I believe this is only the start.
3. **Other online job boards** - Although many platforms specialize in certain industries or job types, their overall size and reach are often limited. This gives UpWork a network advantage due to its larger and more diverse user base.

To summarize: UpWork’s real competition isn’t Fiverr or traditional recruitment agencies; it’s the inertia of the old way of doing business, which is rapidly changing.

  
**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Let's take a look at the fun stuff. UpWork’s financials tell a compelling story of revenue growth and margin expansion. ***What more can one ask for?***

The revenue growth doesn’t come as a surprise, given the ever-growing gig economy. 

*But what about the margins?*

As every company that relies on software, it is not capital-intensive and can scale up without significant investments. The company doesn’t need twice the assets, nor twice the employees, to support twice as much activity on its platform.

As the company grows, the economies of scale kick in, leading to margin expansion.

***Between 2019 and today:***

The revenue grew from \~$300m to \~$740m and the following was introduced:

* Contract initiation fee
* Freelance Plus subscription
* Connects economy (which allows the freelancers to apply to a project)

This led to gross margin expansion **from 71% to 76%.**

In addition, *Sales & Marketing*, and *General & Administrative* continue to decrease as % of revenue.

This leads to improvement of the operating margin **from -6% to +7%.**

In the first half of 2024, UpWork generated **$41m in net profits ($82m annualized)**. The excess cash has been used for share buybacks, and the # of shares outstanding was reduced by **almost 4%**, which is impressive for such a short timeframe.

  
**4.0 Valuation**

Despite all the positives within the company and the earnings report being in line with expectations, the share price was down \~10%.

The market cap of the company is $1.25 billion. Using the annualized profitability of H1-2024, the company trades at a P/E of \~15. This is incredibly low, given the company is still growing (it grew 15% in Q2-2024 vs. Q2-2023) and its margin will expand even more.

The low share price should be welcomed by long-term investors, as it allows the management to buy back even more shares at a lower price.

Based on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to **$1,8 billion ($13,6/share)**. The two key assumptions relate to the revenue growth and the operating margin. Here’s my rationale:

1. **Revenue** - As indicated above, \~4% growth should arise only from the growth in the # of freelancers. As UpWork is dominating the field, I do expect it to attract many existing freelancers as well. In addition, there is the impact of inflation (\~3%/year). All of this combined should lead to at least 8% revenue growth, per year.
2. **Operating margin -** Both the CEO (Hayden Brown) and the CFO (Erica Gessert) emphasized their focus on margin expansion. Their guidance is 35% adjusted EBITDA, which translates to an operating margin of \~20%. I am more conservative in my assumptions and use 15% as the target margin instead.

Here’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you h**ave different assumptions than mine regarding the rev**enue growth over the next decade & the operating margin:

|Revenue / Operating margin|10%|15%|20%|Revenue CAGR |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|60% ($1,2b)|$7,9|$11,9|$15,4|4,8%|
|88% ($1,4b)|$8,9|$13,6|$17,1|6,5%|
|115% ($1,6b)|$9,8|$15,0|$19,7|8,0%|



As I’m writing this, the share price is $9,4, which implies the market expects:

1. Either the operating margin doesn’t increase above \~10%, and/or
2. The average revenue growth over the next decade is below 4%.

***Given the analysis above, I find this unlikely.***

If the management delivers the guided margin expansion, the fair value today is roughly **2x today’s share price.**

As the freelance economy continues to expand, I believe UpWork will increasingly be recognized for its true value.

Target taps Shopify to add sellers to its third-party marketplace ,42,11,2024-06-24,"Target is turning to Shopify to add new and trendier brands to its website.

Starting Monday, the Minneapolis-based discounter said companies that work with Shopify can apply to join Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. Some of Shopify’s customers are smaller or up-and-coming brands that use the e-commerce platform to build and operate a website.

Target and Shopify did not disclose financial terms or the length of the deal.

In an interview with CNBC, Target Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said Shopify will help the retailer discover hot items and quickly make them available for Target’s online shoppers. She said Target plans to put some popular items discovered through the Shopify deal on store shelves.

Target’s marketplace creates a “halo” and is “an accelerant to the total business,” she said. Sylvester added that as the company expands its online assortment and adds eye-catching merchandise, customers tend to visit its website more frequently and buy from both marketplace sellers and Target’s own brands.

The big-box retailer is trying to get back to sales growth as consumers buy less discretionary merchandise, with the discounter lagging behind grocery competitors like Walmart. Target has posted four consecutive quarters of declining comparable sales, and its overall sales have fallen in three of the past four quarters.

The company has struggled to grow its e-commerce business, too. Target’s digital sales grew 1.4% in the first quarter, the first such increase in more than a year.

Company leaders said in May that the retailer is on track to return to sales growth in the second quarter, but that’s partially due to its weak performance year over year. For the full year, Target said it expects comparable sales will range from flat to up 2%, with adjusted earnings per share of $8.60 to $9.60. 

Shares of Target have underperformed the broader stock market. As of Friday’s close, the company’s stock is up about 2% compared with the S&P 500′s nearly 15% increase. Its stock price of $146.13 is also well below the highs it hit during the Covid pandemic years, when it topped $260.

Shopify could also use a boost. Shares tumbled after its earnings report in May and are down about 17% so far this year.

Target Plus has only a tiny fraction of the revenue and sellers of other third-party marketplaces. Unlike Amazon, Walmart, eBay and others, Target allows brands to join by invitation only. It has more than 1,200 sellers, according to Target. Amazon counts about 2 million sellers and Walmart has about 135,000 sellers, according to estimates by Marketplace Pulse, a e-commerce research tracker.

Through the marketplace, Target’s website has carried items like the UnBrush, a detangling hairbrush that went viral on TikTok, and premium products, such as sunglasses from Ray-Ban and Coach. It offers more than 2 million products from brands including Crocs, Ruggable and Timberland. The assortment cuts across many categories including apparel, sporting goods and home decor.

Target said its marketplace has gained momentum. It said its seller and product count have more than doubled over the past calendar year.

The retailer doesn’t split out the revenue made through its third-party marketplace. Instead, it lumps it together in financial filings with “other revenue,” such as money made from credit card profit-sharing and its advertising business, Roundel. That other revenue totaled $388 million, accounting for less than 2% of its $24.53 billion of revenue that it reported in its most recent quarter, which ended May 4.

Yet Sylvester said Target Plus is “one of the fastest growing parts of Target’s business.”

Brands that join Target Plus also become potential customers of Roundel. The advertising business grew by more than 20% in the most recent quarter. Sylvester would not say how much of that came from ads bought by Target Plus sellers.

Third-party marketplaces have become a hot area in retail because they tend to drive higher profits. Instead of buying goods from suppliers, retailers rely on sellers that typically store and own the inventory. Those sellers also take on the financial risks if customers don’t want items or the products must be marked down.

Retailers typically get a cut of sellers’ sales. Plus, they can charge for services, such as fulfilling a brand’s online orders or selling advertisements, like sponsored search results, for sellers’ products.

Target does not offer fulfillment services, instead relying on Target Plus sellers to store, pack and ship their own goods.

Walmart, in particular, has ramped up its marketplace efforts as it tries to close the wide gap with Amazon and its dominant e-commerce platform. It has been recruiting sellers and offering new services, like the ability to ship bulky items like patio furniture or canoes. Sellers in Walmart’s U.S. marketplace grew 36% in the first quarter and it now has more than 420 million unique items, CEO Doug McMillon said on the company’s earnings call in mid-May.

Other marketplaces, such as TikTok Shop and Temu, are growing rapidly, too.

"Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ",434,230,2024-06-22,"Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.

Apple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”

The EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.

The interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.

The loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.

Apple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.

The company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”

"EU launches probe into Meta, Apple and Alphabet under sweeping new tech law",443,156,2024-03-25,"The European Union on Monday opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta, in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation.

“Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s ‘pay or consent model’,” the Commission said in a statement.

The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called “anti-steering rules.” Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

“The way that Apple and Alphabet’s implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,” EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said during a press conference on Monday.

Apple has already fallen foul of the EU’s rules on this. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

The third probe focuses on Alphabet. The European Commission said it is looking into whether Alphabet’s display of Google search results “may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google’s” other services such as Google Shopping over similar rival services.

The fourth probe focuses on Apple. The  Commission said it is investigating whether the company has complied with obligations under the DMA to ensure that users can easily uninstall app on iOS and can easily change default settings on iOS. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine.

The Commission said that it is “concerned that Apple’s measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem.”

The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called “pay and consent” model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The Commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service, is in violation of the DMA.

“The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta’s ‘pay or consent’ model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers.”

Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, said during a press conference that there should be “free alternative options” offered by Meta for its services that are “less personalized.”

Gatekeepers is the term used to label large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU.

 “We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,” Vestager said.

Moderna (MRNA): Does it use AI in its research?,0,10,2024-03-23,"Yes, and not just in the here's-a-press-release-now-buy-our-stock kind of way! They are genuiely a data-centric, cloud native company well positioned to scale using AI.

  
With regards to Moderna & AI, I though the following podcasts were informative: 

1) 13Nov23 ""**Moderna harnesses AI to transform medicine**"" (22mins) 

2) 25Jan24 “**AI and the COVID-19 Vaccine: Moderna’s Dave Johnson**” (20mins) 

3) 15Feb24 ""**Moderna and drug discovery with AI**” (36mins). 

4) **For true depth**: On Moderna's website, their **08Nov23 Digital Investor Event.** It is all about digital/AI. The presentation is impressive, however I recommend watching the webcast as it's  way better than my ramblings below!.... The p34 video link on INT, from design to production, I challenge anyone to not find this JUST AMAZING! 

&#x200B;

However, as much as they use AI, **for me it's just as important that they are digital & since inception have been a cloud native**. By this I mean, **consider their centralized technology platform** (""the Goose"") with their ""apps"" being mRNA drugs (""golden eggs""), which incidentally are entirely designed in silicon on a computer (A, T, C & G rather than zeros & ones!). 

\- For example, typically **Old Pharma requires a sample** **of a virus** to create a vaccine, while **Moderna**’s mRNA technology doesn’t require a virus, **just the genome sequence**. I don't believe the Covid virus was ever on site, there was just no need for it.

&#x200B;

Because this platform has digital characteristics, **the more it is used, the more data it collects, & thus, the more accurate & powerful its future results become**. These ""**Data Assets**"" I've seen referred to several time as **it's competitive advantage** \[an example I heard was along the lines of, what Google does looks simple / basic, however what stops effective competition is their 25+ years of search data.. same idea here with Moderna's 10+Yrs of data!\].

**Learning continuously from clinical trials’ data helps de-risk the pipeline** and, ultimately, **leads to a higher approval rate**.. In Moderna's hands, mRNA is a digital product, a digital medicine, if they can get it to work for one ""indication"" \[BB:= medical condition\], then they can change the code that they put into that & apply it to something else. 

From the 25Jan24 pod referenced above:

1)  at15.40 We were very **thoughtful about how we built this digital landscape such that we're collecting structured data** across all these \[scientific\] steps **& turned this hard earned knowledge into algorithms** \[i.e. To speed up development, improve accuracy/efficiency\]. 

2) at4.50 For our mRNA sequence design, we're coding for some protein but there's a huge number of potential nucleotide sequences that could code for that & you have to try & figure what is the ideal way to get there. **We have algorithms that can do that translation in an optimal way** & we have **others that can then optimize it even further to make it better for production or to avoid things that we know are bad for this mRNA in production or for expression** \[aka doing its job\]. So, scientists just press a button & the work is done for them!

&#x200B;

And AI isn't just used for drug research... 

1) 03Nov21 Pod at3.20 We constructed a manufacturing suite (""**An AI engine**"") that allows our **scientists to order mRNA through online digital tools** & use **AI algorithms** to help automate this into a high throughput, massively parallel, highly automated, small-scale manufacturing facility to provide it

 2) 25Feb21 Pod at31.15 We use the \[manufacturing system\] **to help predict yield or tell the scientist about their sequence**, how easy/difficult it is to produce & **whether they can change some coding in the sequence** of the mRNA to produce the same protein.. It's important that you have **the most efficient way in producing those mRNA.**

Overall, **their AI embedded withing drug design & their manufacturing processes** have been credited with r**educing their cycle time down** from Old Pharma's **6-8yrs to 2yrs** in terms of the entire process they go through for drug development. Which im**plies greater capital efficiency over time**.

&#x200B;

**So......** **What came first, the Chicken or the Egg?:** 

With Moderna, **the PLATFORM came first** (way before Covid came along) **& through it the drugs were created**. The **platform is Moderna's competitive advantage, its moat**..... Old Pharma & other modern mRNA comps can undoubtedly make great drugs, however in my view **they can't compete without its 10+yrs of data assets feeding into its AI/digital platform**.. That's why I'm an investor!

I think this was Amazon when it was $10 [PDD],0,117,2024-03-10,"Wanted to share my due diligence on a stock that is in my portfolio, PinDuoDuo Holdings. I caught a hold of this stock when I was researching BABA, and found out that PDD was not only profitable but was growing 50% + YOY and was also profitable. This got me deep-diving into the stock. I started accumulating after it rebounded at the bottom around $65 and recently added more to the position given the recent correction.  


**Business Operations**  
PDD is an E-commerce business located in China. Their main competitors consist of major players as such Alibaba & [Jd.com](http://Jd.com) but have been snatching a tremendous amount of market share. There are a few key reasons why PDD has been striving so well.

1. With the current recession in China, everybody has been trying to save more and spend less and PDD does exactly just that. They gamify the buying experience for the users, encouraging families and friends to join in on a “group-buy” to get it for a cheaper price. The reason they are able to charge at such competitive prices is they handle directly with the supplier/manufacturer to deliver the goods and attain special prices. PDD handles every single process of the logistics, cutting out unnecessary middlemen. Alibaba also does this with their “Cainiao” logistics company but I think it is less integrated than PDD’s process. This is very clear from the gross margin difference of around 60-75% compared to Alibaba’s 35-40% and also a much higher return on invested capital at 25% and compared to 10%.
2. They focus heavily on their agriculture program. Farmers do not have the best connections/resources, therefore they usually make very thin margins. With PDD they directly engage with the farmers to cut out any unnecessary middleman. They spent 10 billion RMB to create an agriculture program to help address some of the agricultural needs in the country. Once new farmers hit the market, they can receive digital training to become a seller on the platform. This would be a further tailwind for growth in the future. As far as I know, PDD is the only player in the market with this initiative.

**Valuation (PDD)**  
PDD is extremely cheap for a company that is growing this fast. In Q32023 PDD generated RMB 68.840 Billion with a net income of RMB 15.537 Billion. The same time the previous year they generated RMB 35.504 Billion with a net income of RMB 10.589. That is a revenue growth of 94% & earnings growth of 46%! Best part is that they barely dilute the stock which means shareholders retain nearly all of those earnings.

**Here's my DCF Assumption:**  
**FCF Growth Year 1 to 3:** 30% CAGR, **Year 4 to 6:** 22% CAGR, **Year 7-10:** 18% CAGR  
**Outstanding** S**hares(Projected):** 1,631,000,000  
**Discount Rate:** 16%  
**Intrinsic Value:** $132.64/Share  
Now you might say that the discount to the current share price today ($110) does not feel like it gives enough of a margin of safety, however do keep note that I am heavily sandbagging the future growth of this company(they are expected to grow 80% next year) and this already with an extreme discount rate. If you would apply an industry standard of 10% discount rate the intrinsic value of the stock would be **$289/Share!** Of course, there is a reason why I heavily sandbagged the stock which I will explain in the next section.  
  
**Risks of Chinese Equities**  
With the recession happening in China, everything including stocks, and properties have been on a fire sale and getting cheaper for the past 2 years. Even though the fundamentals of the stock are good it can get cheaper for no good reason. Look at JD, it is trading below book value even though cashflow growth is still there, yielding an insane 25% free cash flow. Now investing in PDD might still be viable because despite the recession, it is still growing very fast and is very profitable, so it is somewhat negated this side of the risk slightly.  
Another risk that I have to mention is the VIE structure. When you invest in PDD, you technically do not own shares of the company. You own an entity with a holding company that has made a contract for PDD to distribute profits to that holding company you do not technically own shares of the company. The reason for the is because of the restrictions the CCP has imposed on foreign investments so this is a loophole for international investors. The only reason why PDD is still operating this way is because the CCP closes an eye on these VIE entities. At any moment they could implement a new regulation and completely render the shares worthless.  
Even with the risks I have mentioned, the tech crackdown had already been over for 2 years and the CCP has been inviting people to invest again in China, therefore the risk of the VIE structure falling apart is quite low IMHO.  
  
**Other things to take note off**  
- 36.8% Institutional Ownership  
- 33.6% Insider Ownership (That’s good)  
- 29% Return on Invested Capital TTM  
- Net Debt is zero

**Conclusion**  
Even though the geopolitical risks are there, I think the prospect of the business can continue to thrive even in a recession. With strong growth and profitability, my hope is that PDD can continue to gain market share from its competitors and become a trillion dollar stock in the future.

Apple hit with more than $1.95 billion EU antitrust fine over music streaming,1688,414,2024-03-04,"The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, on Monday hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) antitrust fine for abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.

The Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app.

Apple also banned developers of music streaming apps from providing any instructions about how users could subscribe to these cheaper offers, the Commission alleged.

This is Apple’s first antitrust fine from Brussels and is among one of the biggest dished out to a technology company by the EU.

The European Commission opened an investigation into Apple after a complaint from Spotify in 2019. The probe was narrowed down to focus on contractual restrictions that Apple imposed on app developers which prevent them from informing iPhone and iPad users of alternative music subscription services at lower prices outside of the App Store.

Apple’s conduct lasted almost 10 years, according to the Commission, and “may have led many iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions because of the high commission fee imposed by Apple on developers and passed on to consumers in the form of higher subscription prices for the same service on the Apple App Store.”

Apple response:

In a fiery response to the fine, Apple said Spotify would stand to gain the most from the EU pronouncement.

“The primary advocate for this decision — and the biggest beneficiary — is Spotify, a company based in Stockholm, Sweden. Spotify has the largest music streaming app in the world, and has met with the European Commission more than 65 times during this investigation,” Apple said in a statement.

“Today, Spotify has a 56 percent share of Europe’s music streaming market — more than double their closest competitor’s — and pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped make them one of the most recognisable brands in the world.”

Apple said that a “large part” of Spotify’s success is thanks to the Cupertino giant’s App Store, “along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world.”

Apple said that Spotify pays it nothing. That’s because instead of selling subscriptions in their iOS app, Spotify sell them via their own website stead. Apple does not collect a commission on those purchases.

Developers over the years have spoken out against the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

Spotify did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

The fine will ramp up tensions between Big Tech and Brussels at a time when the EU is increasing scrutiny of these firms.

Last year, the Commission designated Apple among other tech firms like Microsoft and Meta as “gatekeepers” under a landmark regulation called the Digital Markets Act, which broadly came into effect last year.

The term gatekeepers refers to massive internet platforms which the EU believes are restricting access to core platform services, such as online search, advertising, and messaging and communications.

The Digital Markets Act aims to clamp down on anti-competitive practices from tech players, and force them to open out some of their services to other competitors. Smaller internet firms and other businesses have complained about being hurt by these companies’ business practices.

These laws have already had an impact on Apple. The Cupertino, California-based giant announced plans this year to open up its iPhone and iPad to alternative app stores other than its own. Developers have long-complained about the 30% fee Apple charges on in-app purchases.

"Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI",1098,301,2024-02-27,"# Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Shifts Team to Generative AI

&#x200B;

* Company is winding down work on decade-old Project Titan
* Employees on some car teams will move to Apple’s AI division

&#x200B;

[(Bloomberg)](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986) \-- **Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car**, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.

Apple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.

The two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.

The Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.

The decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.

But the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.

The decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.

Most recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.

What some network effect business you invest?,0,1,2024-09-24,"“The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases.”

The Network Effect Defined

The network effect is a business principle that illustrates the idea that when more people use a product or service, its value increases. The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.

Example: social network platforms

The network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform’s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual’s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.

Example: E-commerce platforms 

E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.

I currently invest in MSFT,GOOGL,META,V,MA. What else companies do you invest in?

Optimization for inverse problem solving in computer-generated holography,0,1,2024-09-04,"Computer-generated holography (CGH) provides an approach to digitally modulate a given wavefront. 

This technology, partly inherited from optical holography and partly advanced by the progress of computing technology, has become an emerging focus of academia and industry.

CGH, encoded on various types of holographic media, enable a wide range of applications. 

Holograms fabricated as diffractive optical elements or metasurfaces can reproduce specific spatial light fields, achieving structured light projection, data storage, and optical encryption. 

With refreshable devices like spatial light modulators, CGH is able to assist many fields of investigation, including three-dimensional (3D) display, holographic lithography, optical trapping, and optogenetics.

In a new paper published in *Light: Science & Applications*, a team of scientists, led by Professor Liangcai Cao from the Department of Precision Instruments, Tsinghua University, China, and Professor Daping Chu from the Centre for Photonic Devices and Sensors, University of Cambridge, UK review the [optimization](https://phys.org/tags/optimization/) algorithms applied to computer-generated holography, incorporating principles of hologram synthesis based on alternative projections and gradient descent methods.

Finding the exact solution of a desired hologram to reconstruct an accurate target object constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. The general practice of single-diffraction computation for synthesizing holograms can only provide an approximate answer and it is subject to limitations in numerical implementation.

TULSA, OK, Aug. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RJD Green Inc. (OTCPK: RJDG) CEO Ron Brewer discusses where RJD Green is at in 2024, and what is expected in the remainder of 2024 and 2025 on “The Street Report Podcast”.

Podcast Link: [https://thestreetreports.com/rjd-green-inc-otc-rjdg-ceo-featured-on-the-street-reports-podcast-listen-now-see-stocks-under-5%c2%a2-to-watch-inside/](https://thestreetreports.com/rjd-green-inc-otc-rjdg-ceo-featured-on-the-street-reports-podcast-listen-now-see-stocks-under-5%c2%a2-to-watch-inside/)

CEO Ron Brewer discussed the progressions through 2024, and what he expects to occur in the remainder of 2024 and in 2025.  
Ron Brewer, CEO stated:

“As we have finished the first half of calendar year and moving into the remainder of 2024, RJD Green’s divisions have all achieved some milestones in moving forward in revenue growth or achieving progression that will initiate growth.

“Our primary focus has been revenue and profit growth that hopefully will stimulate stock value. 

“We have achieved that primarily in the Silex Holdings construction products division, while beginning to break some of the bearers of IoSoft Systems’ efforts within the healthcare payment systems software.

“At the start of 2024 we set a goal to achieve $10,000,000 in annual revenue with 15% or greater net operating profit. The action steps are to acquire small add-on opportunities that will complement our current internal growth which is on course for $6,000,000 revenue with 20% NOP.

“Although we are a microcap entity, we have solid financial performance, currently holding over $1,800,000 in capital.

“We are already in three months of negotiations on two construction product companies that either would increase our annual revenue to over $10,000,000 and contribute 15% to 18% NOP. We are in similar negotiations with two smaller software development firms that offer broadening our products and business sectors while increasing our IT team in the IoSoft Systems division. Both have products that have been introduced to the market and are ready for a regional to national marketing campaign.

“We feel once we establish a consistent $10,000,000 profitable revenue we can move up to a larger small-cap trading board, and also enhance stock value, while accessing the next level of investment interest for small-cap symmetrical acquisitions.

“We also feel the introduction of new products in Silex Holdings and new software in IoSoft will reflect additional internal growth in 2025.

“We continue to work diligently to execute our business model to create a substantive holding company with a focus on acquiring and managing assets and companies.”

**RJD Green operates in three divisions:** 

RJD Green Healthcare Services Division, has absorbed IoSoft proprietary software directly into RJD Green and rebranded as **IoSoft Systems, a division of RJD Green Inc**. The rebranding allows us to reflect the broadening of our additional focuses for IoSoft that are being initiated in 2024.

IoSoft Systems will continue to provide discrete payment technologies, services, and software platforms that can integrate into targeted offerings for healthcare provider networks, hospitals, healthcare payers, as well as the insurance and financial transection sectors. The IoSoft team is exploring joint ventures and licensing agreements to expand growth of the unique medical software platforms more rapidly.

Additionally, IoSoft Systems has created additional software platforms ready for the market that apply to banking, insurance, and other more universal market segments such as hospitality. IoSoft is also focusing on custom software development programs that can be white label agreements, or joint ventures.

IoSoft Systems continues pursuing relationships within the initial focus of Third-Party Administrators (TPA) in the health care sector with contracts now being serviced and creating additional contracts. The TPA sector has been a longer-term growth in clients than was anticipated. While increasing our presence in this sector, IoSoft is focusing on acquiring and creating additional software platforms that focus on the common needs of universal sectors. This allows IoSoft to pursue custom software development and software support contracts in sectors that include healthcare, insurance, legal, hospitality, and financial services.

*  Segregation of Claims
*  Provider Information and  Communications Management

~Outsourced IT Needs~  
The services include special technology and software company projects, essential technologies support and development, help desk, and network management services. The many benefits for the active small-cap company include:

§  Cost Reductions  
§  Expedited projects   
§  Freeing up internal resources  
§  Outside business guidance for increased profitability thru technology application  
§  Scalability

Vincent Valentine, Division Manager, states: ""We are pleased to be expanding our services and business sectors. These efforts are synergistic with IoSoft’s white label and independent software development services.”

**RJD Green’s Construction Products Division - Silex Holdings Inc.**

The commercial division has continued its revenue growth and geographic expansion with new commercial contracts awarded Silex. This sector offers greater gross margin revenue and is more recession resistant. The commercial efforts continue to increase our revenue and profit base annually.

Silex Holdings homebuilder business will continue to grow in 2024 as Silex has enlarged their effort in high-end custom homebuilders creating 11% higher gross margins. High-end custom homes ($1,000,000 to $30,000,000) will continue to offer increased revenues with greater profit margins.

Silex continues to service the total homebuilder opportunity anchoring the homebuilder revenues and production efficiencies.

Also, Silex has targeted the designer, remodel, and retail sectors for significant revenue growth from previous years. To enhance efforts in this focus we are launching a comprehensive ongoing marketing program focused on these sectors. We have created 4,000-square foot kitchen and bath showrooms in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma with these targeted markets in mind.

**Earthlinc Environmental Services Division** provides green environmental proprietary technologies for environmental services. 

The Company is servicing a product development program utilizing Agrico Corp’s forestation program processes, and an ongoing joint venture effort with Winport Inc. on an international land development and environmental reclamation, with the goal of utilizing Earthlinc’s patented animal waste recycling and repurposing utilization.",/r/pennystocks/comments/1eww08b/rjd_green_incs_ceo_ron_brewer_discusses_company/,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
"Stanford University announced new results of AI holographic imaging, which makes AI a broader future",0,1,2024-05-16,"A team from Stanford University has developed a new AI-assisted holographic imaging technology, which is thinner, lighter and of higher quality than existing solutions, expected to open a new chapter for augmented reality (AR) glasses.

**Development of new AI-assisted holographic imaging**

The current prototype has a narrow field of vision, only 11.7 degrees in the lab environment, far less than Magic Leap 2 or even Microsoft HoloLens.

In addition, the prototype fully shows unlimited potential, which can realize the holographic component stack in the frame of standard glasses, and produce realistic full-color mobile 3D images with different depths through AI training projection.

The prototype, like other AR glasses, uses waveguides to guide light through the glasses and into the wearer’s eyes. But the team developed a unique “nanophotonic metasurface waveguide”, which no longer required cumbersome collimatation optics, and trained AI algorithms to “learn a physical waveguide model” to improve image quality.

In today’s digital age, the transition from 2D imaging to 3D imaging is a technological leap that has brought tremendous changes to daily life and professional fields. Hologram is not the latest technology. It dates back to the 1960s.



**Holographic imaging of the “magic”**

As the name suggests, holographic imaging technology uses the principle of interference and diffraction to record and reproduce the real image of an object, which requires more than 100 times more information than ordinary camera processing, and puts forward high requirements for shooting, processing and transmission platform. Therefore, the earliest holographic technology is only used to process static photos.

For example, in science fiction movies, people are thousands of miles away, but the holographic projection makes it stand in front of people in front of real people, talk and move. Or in the holographic imaging class, students can see vivid professors and even famous teachers from all over the world without wearing 3D glasses, as if to interact with students face to face across time and space. And this is the application of “holographic imaging technology”, the magical changes brought to people’s lives.

Industry experts analyzed that such a sci-fi scenario, with the development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology and the commercial use of 5G, holographic imaging technology will be combined with various technologies to bring users a more realistic virtual experience. At the same time, holographic imaging technology also provides new ways for many businesses to publicize it, and may be widely used in the fields of architecture, design, health and military.

"Sora became the focus of ChatGPT in the AI field, WiMi seized the opportunity",0,4,2024-03-20," 

With the rapid development of science and technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the hottest topics in the world today. Following ChatGPT, OpenAI introduced a video generation model, Sora, which pushes AI technology to a new visual dimension.

Sora is based on the past research on the DALL E and GPT models, and the core technology is the diffusion transformer model of DiT. Sora’s release once again proves that transformer technology, as a basic technology of artificial intelligence, is equally important in multimodal large models, including video technology.

The Sora model generates complex scenarios with multiple roles, specific types of movements, and precise details of the subject and background. The model can understand not only what the user asks for in the prompt, but also how these things exist in the real world. OpenAI Said they are teaching AI how to understand and simulate the physical world in motion, with the goal of training models to help people solve problems that require real-world interaction.

The birth of Sora means that the era of AIGC may have come, and tools like Sora may profoundly disrupt the future of content creation and business. With the continuous popularity of Wensheng video model Sa, the attention of the capital market is also rising. It is generally believed that the launch of Sora will bring a historic opportunity for change to the AI industry chain.

**Apple’s AI innovation**

On February 28, Apple held an annual shareholder meeting, at which Apple CEO Tim Cook again expressed his views on Apple’s AI plan.

“” Mr Cook said the company will “break new ground” in generative AI in 2024: ” We believe it will bring transformative opportunities for our users.」

In recent months, Cook has repeatedly expressed his vision for Apple’s AI ambitions. Apple is adding new generative AI features to iOS 18 and plans to use AI to improve the capabilities of many built-in iOS apps.

**WiMi explores AIGC market**

As the launch of Sora brings new opportunities, some listed companies with cutting-edge technology layout in the AI industry chain have a first-mover advantage. Data show that the listed enterprise WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI) attaches great importance to the research and development and application of all kinds of AI technologies, and pays close attention to the emerging AI Wensheng video technology platform represented by Sora.

In fact, WiMi has established an AIGC innovative application team for a long time, and developed AIGC technology is widely applied in various business scenarios such as live broadcast operation, advertising, voice interaction, video editing, and content production. WiMi actively explores the deep integration of its own brand advantages, content advantages and cutting-edge technology, and strives to realize the innovative integration of technology and industry.

Now, the release of the video generation model Sora has brought vast opportunities and development to the AI industry chain, and has naturally become the focus of wide attention of WiMi. Now WiMi has laid out the multi-modal large model related development stage of AI video, including the fusion training and processing of multimodal signals such as vision, voice and text, which will realize the penetration of downstream application scenarios such as video, 3D, games and home.

With the rapid development of AI in the field of multi-modal video generation, looking forward to the future, WiMi will actively explore the application and business innovation of emerging AI technologies such as video generation in the industrial field, so as to bring more rich and diversified application scenarios and more mature commercial models.

**To sum up**

Globally, the historical process of AI to change human society has just begun, and it is destined to make greater breakthroughs. It is expected that many related industries with AI as the core are expected to be driven in 2024. With AI technology booming, how to maintain the core competitiveness of the business in the AIGC era has become the soul of a number of technology companies. In this process, it has become an industry consensus to embrace the era of AI technology and catch the train of AIGC.

In short, it can be predicted that in the near future, artificial intelligence will be everywhere, promoting information skills from digital, network, to fully into the intelligent era. Therefore, the future application scenarios based on AI still need to be continuously explored. AI video generation is only a small direction in the multi-modal technology path, and the ChatGPT moment in the multi-modal field has not yet arrived.",/r/pennystocks/comments/1bj7ark/sora_became_the_focus_of_chatgpt_in_the_ai_field/,0.4215,0.177,0.0,0.823

"Vision Pro Stimulate the XR market, Meta / WiMi are involved in AR construction",1,2,2024-03-07," 

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Meta (META) is hoping that the launch of Vision Pro will help it boost the company’s XR headset business.

Media executives, including Zuckerberg, are optimistic about the launch of Vision Pro, saying Apple’s push into the headset market would “test the possibilities of their existing business and attract more consumers”, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple (AAPL) has moved from virtual to mixed reality. With the Vision Pro released in the U. S., Meta employees believe that Quest and its software ecosystem will be Apple’s main rival in the metauniverse and a role similar to Google Android in the smartphone space.

Apple’s entry into the headset space marks the latest chapter in Apple’s competition with Meta. Meta executives and industry insiders believe the future battle will focus on software as it will play a huge role in developing apps that will attract more users.

**The project shows the new AR interaction function**

In addition, Reality Labs researchers in Meta’s XR division recently demonstrated a way to interact with the real world through augmented reality (AR). This research can not only digitize the real objects in the real world but also can seamlessly erase the corresponding real objects after generating the virtual objects.

Reality Labs The researchers called the concept “scene responsiveness,” claiming that the approach created a “visual illusion of virtual action affecting physical scenes,” and presented their results at the ACM User Interface Software and Technology Workshop late last year.

**The XR market has a huge space for development**

Apple’s Vision Pro began pre-orders on January 19, and pre-sale data for the first weekend showed initial strong demand. It is worth mentioning that before the Vision Pro launch, the global XR industry had experienced more than ten years of development, but due to the lack of high-quality content, the development of the industry encountered a bottleneck.

Now, for the development trend of the market, Apple set off a heat wave, directly driving many big factories in the XR industry are reform. Counterpoint Research Analysis, ” Although the launch of Apple Vision Pro will not immediately change the entire industry pattern, it will undoubtedly take an important step forward and will guide the future development direction of the XR industry.

**WiMi built the AR ecosystem**

It has to be said that XR has once again become the focus of the tech industry this year, and over the past few years, everyone has been waiting for the “iPhone moment” of XR. With Apple officially entering the game, expect to be taken to a very high point. In particular, Apple’s first Vision Pro sales, hot sales are very good, to the XR industry impact is very obvious.

According to public information, the first WiMi Hologram Cloud (NASDAQ: WIMI), actively build an AR ecosystem, take the AR industry as the base, accelerate the further development of industrial ecology, and will work with industry partners to build the development of the XR industry. According to the introduction, WiMi Hologram Cloud has a special platform for AR to carry out product development and commercialization promotion and has successively realized the research and development of several AR and VR products.

At the same time, in hardware manufacturing, software development, content production, and channel distribution, the WiMi Hologram Cloud layout is also earlier. In terms of software, it has considerable technical strength and scale effect. In terms of content development, it applies to nearly 5,000 IP projects and is actively mature in advertising, games, video production, and other aspects.

In addition, the WiMi Hologram Cloud sends a signal to the outside world that XR will develop faster, and more attention will be paid to application, ecological landing, and other aspects. It is reported, that WiMi Hologram Cloud will plan to build a metaverse scenic area, metaverse museum, metaverse exhibition hall, metaverse wisdom classroom, XR industrial roaming, XR vocational training, XR wisdom city multiple scenarios, covering wenbo, consumption, industry, education, and other digital industry, further explore XR human-computer interaction ability and scene, help users realize experience jumped.

**To sum up**

After a decade of silence, XR finally ushered in a chance to “turn over”, Apple’s decade of grinding a sword of Vision Pro officially entered the public, XR concept is more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Just as the iPhone and App Store opened the entire generations of mobile Internet, XR has the potential to disrupt will be the entire industry.

Of course, with Meta, Apple, WiMi Hologram Cloud, and other technology giants in the application ecology layout of XR earlier, it has formed a certain user scale and brand influence. In the future, it will bring users a smooth user experience and open a new lifestyle while liberating hands.",/r/pennystocks/comments/1b8ndru/vision_pro_stimulate_the_xr_market_meta_wimi_are/,0.4404,0.245,0.0,0.755
$CAUD staking it's claim in the ad-tech market,7,1,2024-02-15," Collective Audience Is A Media Industry Game Changer; Its 47% February Rally Supports That Thesis ($CAUD)

 Collective Audience, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAUD) is a media industry game-changer in many respects. And investors are taking notice, sending CAUD shares higher by over 47% since the start of February. However, while the run is indeed impressive, it's likely the precursor to even higher gains, especially as CAUD continues to actively stake its claim in an audience-based performance advertising and ad-tech sector that's expected to reach $2.9 trillion over the next seven years.

The magnitude of how significant a trillion-dollar market potential is can't be under-appreciated, particularly at a time when the once thought of as impossible mission to become a billionaire has been scored by an ever-growing number of people. Many professional investors thought that a company reaching the trillion-dollar market cap was a far stretch of optimism. But that's been breached too, with Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) all holding valuations closer to two trillion than one.

The interesting part of what's happening in the investment world is that these valuations are being scored while everyone's watching. The issue, however, is that many people and investors only see what they want to see and ignore, not always intentionally, the most monumental changes in global business and lifestyle landscapes.

**Collective Audience Targets Massive Ad-Tech Market**

A shift deserving immediate attention is how artificial intelligence, including the peripheries around it, is disrupting the way companies do business. That disruption is more than excellent news for clients needing best-in-class services; it also is for investors looking to exploit opportunities exposed by innovative companies, like Collective Audience, which are capitalizing on potentially massive revenue-generating opportunities by being in the right sector with the right products at the right time. For a company like CAUD, valued at roughly $16.06 million on Wednesday, earning just a tiny slice of the market potential can be transformative. ***(\* share price and market cap on 02/14/2024, Yahoo! Finance, 11:38 AM EST)***

But know this: CAUD wants to collect more than just market leftovers. And they intend to succeed in its mission by leveraging a products and services portfolio arsenal that can support earning an impressive share of the opportunities targeted. To ensure staying on track, CAUD has assembled a leadership team that includes a Who's Who list of best-in-industry overachievers that can turn sales ambitions into tangible revenues. The company's recently announced addition of [Peter Bordes](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/11/2793882/0/en/Collective-Audience-Appoints-Technology-Visionary-Investor-and-Executive-Leader-Peter-Bordes-as-Chief-Executive-Officer.html) as CEO complements that list.

Wall Street knows him for all the right reasons. For investors who don't and are evaluating the CAUD value proposition, pay attention because he may help to quickly close the disconnect between his company's assets, potential, and share price. There's plenty to appreciate in the bio above. But the biggest reason for investors to embrace his leadership is that he has a proven track record of making small companies bigger. In most cases, substantially so. And now leading CAUD, and alongside some of the world's brightest business minds, history in that respect may repeat.

In fact, that's likely, considering CAUD has captured one of the digital sector GOAT's, and by doing so, has positioned themselves to become one of the most dynamic and influential companies in its target markets. 

**An Innovative Products And Services Arsenal**

That presumption supports the case that even after its impressive February run, considerable earned value may still be neglected in its current market cap. Missing from its current valuation goes well beyond overlooking its leadership team. In may also neglect to fairly appraise the value inherent to CAUD assets, which already position the company to target its increasing market opportunities. More value should be applied after CAUD [announced completing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/collective-audience-issues-shares-logiq-121000309.html) the business combination with DLQ, Inc., a former subsidiary of Logiq, Inc (OTCQX: LGIQ), and [Abri SPAC I, Inc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASPA?p=ASPA&.tsrc=fin-srch)., a special purpose acquisition company that previously traded on NASDAQ that held an over $64 million market cap. Nearly 4X higher than CAUD's current. 

However, as noted, the valuation gap could close quickly, a likely proposition after CAUD debuted on the NASDAQ market in November 2023. That uplist could attract significant analyst attention. A bullish view could send CAUD stock prices soaring, considering that only about 13.73 million shares are O/S, with roughly 83% of those tightly held by insiders and another 5.2% owned by institutional investors. That leaves a relatively small number of shares in the public float, a consideration that can help fuel and sustain a rally.

The bullish speculation is more than warranted, especially by factoring companies needs for an ally like CAUD to help them make better use of their ad budgets and publishers needing to leverage expertise to more effectively and quickly monetize their content. Keep in mind that while the ad-tech sector is expected to reach trillion-dollar levels in less than eight years, it's already substantial, estimated at $748 billion in revenue-generating potential just three years ago. From there, and with an expected CAGR of 14.7% into the next decade, the case for CAUD bulls gets appreciably stronger, supported by a combined products and services platform specifically designed to identify, convert, and monetize the collective audience of leading brands and publishers.

**Right Space, Right Strategy, Right Assets**

Those intrinsic abilities put CAUD in an enviable spot to grow bigger and faster than even the staunchest CAUD bulls might expect. That case is not purely speculative, either. It's supported by CAUD's abilities to target lucrative opportunities alongside some of the world's largest companies, including Meta (NASDAQ: META) and those mentioned, which rely almost exclusively on ad revenues for top and bottom-line growth. That's not all. While the large caps may have the means to fend off potential problems in the competitive landscape, thousands of other companies, especially smaller ones, don't have the financial or technical resources to keep pace with changes. Their challenge can be significant value drivers for CAUD. The better news in that respect is that CAUD can provide services that others can't to fill soaring demand.

Industry competitors like The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), PubMatic (NASDAQ: PUBM), and Magnite (NASDAQ: MGNI), as good as they are in their respective target markets, certainly can't handle the entirety of the market demand. Even factoring in the niche-focused companies like Digital Turbine (NASDAQ: APPS) and DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), while it helps, still leaves considerable revenues for the taking. CAUD intends to earn its rightful share.

That's no coincidence. As a U.S.-based provider of e-commerce and digital customer acquisition solutions that simplify digital advertising, its proof of concept and performance attracts the right eyes by being an innovative, data-driven, end-to-end provider with solutions facilitating access to data for activating campaigns across multiple channels. Its digital marketing business includes a holistic, self-serve adtech platform, a proprietary data-driven, and an AI-powered system that enables brands and agencies to advertise across thousands of the world's leading digital media and connected TV platforms. All of that's important.

Remember, digital marketing is widely considered the optimal solution for companies to communicate with prospective and existing customers to create business and brand awareness. Moreover, its value extends because digital marketing provides an easy way for companies to get creative and stand out from competitors in congested markets. That's led to significant adtech spending, with many companies targeting the customers' time spent on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Of course, those apps target millions of users. However, as large as they are, other apps, retail media, and gaming environments add billions of additional viewers' eyes. And CAUD wants to connect them to the right interest through retail media, connected television, and E-commerce channels that generate specific metrics and attribution models.

**A CAUD Valuation Disconnect Exposed**

With the tools and abilities in place to bring audience objectives to life quickly, efficiently, and effectively, CAUD is not a sector player to ignore. The 47% February increase indicates many investors aren't. But clients are taking notice, too. And that's the real value driver behind the investment proposition since it can lead to a further steepening of CAUD's revenue curve.

Thus, using virtually any valuation model, especially based on a sum of its parts calculus, CAUD presents a compelling value investment proposition. While investors are apparently taking advantage of its $1.15 share price on Wednesday, these levels still present what many refer to as ground floor levels. But with momentum at its back, bargain prices may not last much longer, a premise supported by a new era of internet and consumer landscapes that make adtech and the facilitators behind the space, like Collective Audience, an invaluable and necessary competitive tool.

I believe they  will be able to capture significant market share in any ecosystem they  are allowed to enter. Two important events have occurred since [my last article on High Tide](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d710bf36641%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,XrKMnxI-3CdTh-d-QuR7RwliqOqKmqWI2JFIKge-nnxZHUrcZw64dUyyO0wm3Idz4Uff_t94mC5CJyin3Mqt8lChRzE25HyC1i1ffjwBJUulgMlYhu2BmyuW&typo=1).

After looking over their present financials and valuation, I currently rate High Tide as a Strong Buy.

## Company Overview

High Tide is a discount cannabis retailer headquartered in Calgary,  Canada. They have 158 stores in Canada and exposure to markets in  Europe, The United States, and internationally. They have vertically  integrated the production and distribution of cannabis accessories. They  also own [three of the top five](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3decbea30cac%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,meRziZsxCLWGu5QDhChSshlswIXBCGWQqV82lktqr7wP3AOkrRgpgENmo7PXrQus7-mdT92f1Ukn0Cb4dhEOhGrJzvZr9LuJTiZ72-hevm-2uJiyRH0,&typo=1) highest  traffic cannabis E-commerce platforms. Also, they operate a data  analytics service platform, and are continuing to roll out their  automated kiosks which operate under the name Fastendr.

High Tide’s CEO-founder Harkirat “Raj” Grover started with a single  store and two employees in 2009. He has built this empire up to 158  stores generating a quarterly revenue over $94M USD. By refusing to grow  cannabis and instead vertically integrating the production of  accessories, this company is in a unique situation where their business  model has them selling cannabis as a loss leader. When consumers enter  their stores for the ultra-cheap cannabis, they are also offered higher  margin accessories. Not only does this give them an unparalleled ability  to capture market share, they also place a downward pressure on the  retail price of cannabis.

As most of their competition has been forced to divest away from growing cannabis in order to survive, they currently have [more cannabis-based revenue](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d80ea6fd73b%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,IbYsJwrWy2Yvl1CgN6PTbqMzkRyfsb8yzhyUsyYG_vODt4A0_74qpw2YmYfkk32StuxjUlcHPT7EmKAcvFP_heIYCqpG1n5YS8s2-bsh&typo=1) than  any other company in Canada. Their founder-CEO has repeatedly made  clear their intentions to expand into both Germany and the United States  as soon as the laws allow.

## Born In A Gladiatorial Deathmatch

I began researching the cannabis industry in early 2021 when the  entire industry rallied into valuations that left logic behind. I knew  most of the industry was extremely unprofitable, so I chose to wait for  it to cool off before I began buying. While I waited, I was given ample  opportunities to examine the various business models the companies were  developing.

Both the Canadian and the U.S. sectors were suffering, but for very  different reasons. The players in the United States were all being  crushed by the oppressive [280e tax obligation](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3dbddd2331a5%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,j8lUuGFX9zuuTVW5WMQcpMJ3--EtO2diIM6NCDqs1mcQbAockPvuTSdlqH3sfCLZFylafIFLpUt0lvVYM4cJtSZ-oDvlDQfRzVDeHo7NFFWM3j_PpQ,,&typo=1). Also, the highly competitive environment up in Canada lead to [overproduction](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3def4932bff9%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,ipBwqNIOtLWPP64p6Y61ywXtN07ZDWM-zTrJEjxxKsjpWsTmEGPkj1G5w2aFBWotnQuWLrYZTA3n8A7ORoocqRmnpCFXe3_pDiYT26T6Xrk,&typo=1) and [a price war](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3ddfce2675e4%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,vIXkksbShU6AGVbPffozWfMaz25iXgQO3QfXVnzpCjDHg2jdgR_GneaTxd-vLFkgWipYbx-Bv2KUUMFJ7G4bz0xRuSj-cY9sc3YR1dFgIl5xXhsBDnpK&typo=1) was  forcing most of the sector to operate with negative gross margins.  After watching both sectors for a few months, it became clear to me that  the companies up in Canada were under far more stress than those in the  United States. I have been studying Applied Game Theory for many years  now, so I knew that Canada’s more competitive environment was going to  take [many victims](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d09f262ecd3%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,-ncdcDJSehQbPJs_JwhdNj4Ff_l677-LQqu6C8SV-fJ__HjSOmk6D0ReF2GktLIovxRxr11PCGdWWAb8fGT-lkYQLYB4kt70la9_Omt3qvNEFHSCMs1bbAOL&typo=1). I also knew that the survivors would only be able to avoid bankruptcy by becoming extremely efficient.

I shifted more of my attention to Canada’s more competitive market  because the companies there had been placed on what Sun Tsu refers to as  Death Ground. They were forced to adapt or die. Most of the larger  players abandoned their original strategies. Canopy Growth Corporation ([CGC](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d5dcedf369a%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,dc-yRSae3J5dTg8uNndvW3TuYO1vbp4FwN51ASENOiPACPzExMq0INAM7M2U9PTR0ZYeEIbG3YDjcMwdxL0BIO71cDxrjKGnu3f-2FZfYWrBwyNIPUireg,,&typo=1)) divested away all of its [Canadian retail locations,](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d9c7dd29d8b%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,8Pg7aZILgdsfWieA9J5_hXHJQ4sU-X_l1zjhPp23bWwOXRjprkh_ptHJtnI6yuj3lSyaGsafEMbdhDexKE2FJlS1SzRyr0PdGlmj-RLoZgxxrdpG0mAMwbAhKlwT&typo=1) SNDL Inc.

That last choice caught my attention in a very big way. With all of  the largest players in the Canadian sector already suffering from  overproduction and negative gross margins, a relatively unknown retailer  decided it was a good idea to alter its business model into one which  places additional downward pressure on the price of cannabis. I decided  this company was worth a deeper dive, and was *not* disappointed.

When they made the switch, they controlled roughly 3.6% of the  Canadian market. Since then, their discount model has captured market  share at a rate slightly under 1% per quarter. Excluding Quebec, they  currently control approximately [9.5%](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3decb744a321%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,-y72hI7hJBSHBFKPWIfFbUqRZIezMLB7Ly5O00QlfQ6xi-tYTL-3YC8gVvQUZYP3qOQP2Q1_HBeRHUE8e-ixypfq11nLhvGuXh0Iv44Jdu8j&typo=1) of the market.

Cannabis consumers are highly price sensitive, so they are willing to  drive right past non-discount stores to reach better deals. During a  period where everyone else was struggling to find a viable business  model, High Tide was opening new stores while capturing market share.  This increased the stress the rest of the industry was already under.  The situation became dire enough that High Tide’s primary competitor,  Fire & Flower, was knocked out of the game and found itself [filing for bankruptcy](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3dd710fe5a5f%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,wkzCGfaNornYn-fFiifBMidZgTYO4LUawmuW-_xCLXWTJpEF3m878EnHaRvz98H2sjGWyPIU51t-5Xprp3tW42Nz7OT_oa-UEDm1pdVn2j98tbAiGdRapM_CexI,&typo=1) this last summer.

## Quarterly Financials

I should note that this is a Canadian company which reports in  Canadian dollars and the values I use here in the financials section are  all in USD.

Their quarterly revenue chart is clearly showing their impressive  growth, emphasizing how wildly popular their discount model is among  consumers. Eight quarters ago High Tide had a quarterly revenue of  $38.5M. Four quarters ago that had grown to $74.5M. By this most recent  quarter that had further increased to $94.3M. This represents a total  two-year rise of 144.94% at an average quarterly rate of 18.12%.

## Valuation In Isolation

As of November 28th, 2023, High Tide had a market capitalization of $109.5M and had a market price of $1.42 per share. Overall, [their valuation metrics](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d9aff79e962%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,C0MrckkNqZdAN3p2pBAez7xLXw7IQaJfQxMq42Jq43XwpHGmtX5FtyNaHP4oO9CGXRgZOC9epoKA4m6O2MmvmtFiSOMOYGKQVHyQXNlTiBdzlIAOL94,&typo=1) are  attractive, but they do not have positive net income, so I cannot use  the PEGY method to produce an estimate for intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9naedjiggb4c1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef33465e73d036a8120a8ac98596bc436a23d0b5

While being more profitable than most of them, High Tide has a lower  trailing Price/Sales ratio than the top five recreational cannabis  companies in the United States. With them currently at a 0.30x, they are  less than half the price of Cresco Labs ([OTCQX:CRLBF](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d0be27d85e7%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,IKTu2Am9T4Nvz71HG0kvlD2yOh2PEgsHQMSMmEsPUBqxwcmrzJ0qsfvVPo2-2SoHphYpdjRmgVCP8-6sg7Oo2Cw_thS9GzBQT8E5YvaWX4SFDTY3VnE,&typo=1)), which is the next cheapest one by revenue.

## Valuation History

The cannabis industry experiences euphoric rallies which have a  history of leaving rational valuations behind. In the time since both of  the last two industry-wide rallies, the company has grown itself from a  small, relatively unknown entity, to the highest revenue cannabis  company in Canada. I expect it to receive far more attention during the  next rally than it did during either of the previous two.

In 2019, High Tide reached a trailing P/S ratio of 7.53x. During the  last industry wide rally in early 2021 they reached a trialing P/S of  2.66x. They are currently trading at a 0.30x. If the next rally carries  them to their previous P/S ratios, that would translate to 2,410% gain  in share price for the 2019 peak, and an 786% gain for the 2021 peak.

https://preview.redd.it/0ysw934pgb4c1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=473fdb39e90007e4ae98bfcd20da07fc382ebf49

HITI Trailing Price/Sales History

I get a very different result when I instead chose to view them based  on a Price/Book ratio. During the 2019 rally, they peaked at a  Price/Book of 4.48x. During the 2021 rally they reached a 17.09x. From  today’s 0.92x, if they were to reach their former values the 2019 rally  would translate to a 356% gain in share price. If it were to reach their  2021 peak, it would be a 17,576% gain.

https://preview.redd.it/etufsbxrgb4c1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ea0c70134679efbdcafbabf11cfe2897846e848

## Hidden Margin of Safety

As I consider myself a growth-oriented value investor, I typically  avoid talking about margin of safety on any company without positive Net  Income. However, because this company is running a deep discount model,  and can choose how deep they push their deals, High Tide has far more  control over its margins than most business models. As long as they are  reasonable goals, this means they are able to more easily achieve  specific financial targets. If they ever find themselves in danger of  failure, they can always raise prices.

The picture below illustrates this clearly. Their discount model has  them offering cannabis at prices significantly lower than the market  average to Cabana Club members. Those who pay the annual fee to become  Elite members pay even less. While this is only a single example, in  this case Cabana Club members are presented with a 27.44% discount,  while Elite members are offered a 35.8% discount. Considering their Q3  earnings report had a net margin of -2.86%, it’s pretty clear that this  company could be net income positive whenever it wants. Their  flexibility with pricing grants investors a significant margin of  safety, one which is difficult to quantify using traditional valuation  methods.

## Catalysts

The company faces numerous catalysts. The most obvious one to cite is rescheduling. On October 6th, [President Biden](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3dba72b668ae%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,D4d4G5vTH-zbxA3Y1JuD1iOp2R5NNn8qCjQzYG6q2J6uolgC7hpi8AQU4IOdafEwO-7nQY4KLc7FTRpSlf83Jm5Q5CS6dPZbojNqpgp4iUh9waukotODNhrrSzHq&typo=1) began  the process by asking the DHHS and the Attorney General to review the  available evidence and reassess its present schedule 1 status. By the [end of this last summer](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d3fc83eaf38%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,5xfh0iDgxnzBXsV21LLZQmFQhZY_HXcm5uFlcpP72JULiWLvfSdlRR-nwpg2cG--D84_WVydidUMBv2xsX_7yh3IKcvGdXfsJFfWB7NAO3HtB99stUgEpn4,&typo=1), the general public was made aware that the DHHS recommended that it should become schedule 3. [The industry is still waiting](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3db62da4c83b%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,FOuYVxupVstXPMZGx8akx8vt10u9UtM4UFfMYGeKjYzYvqUgnyV-FkiTUzpLfIpZLnVxzcuS9L9rbFwkSOkET2H9vI9evd3QPo6qKi52AG8KpeGPaKdh&typo=1) on the DEA to finish [their assessment](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3da650752d50%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,u5YoFg53H8PC0OuuVXi2-K_XRT0rdXnCvpvRfpYs6GO_BBvX_8fcp4NQ5HGMrwTFgNX2nmpiWEDVcsI1FusL4nQDVxGEHEN26jZXCsNJikLt1TwBwhZgjw,,&typo=1) before the Federal Government will complete the reclassification process.

The other industry wide catalyst to cite is the passage of some form of [SAFE Banking Act.](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d002fadc704%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,TFAwqlZY3gLN6IX_9hk4XPyDH46zPhzF0V0W5ehY5lx96KesEPguuldOvKnYkptAAVh_GGOTNepi9lOubROUxKF-Z4PRZ3pxmKML2n1N5Tmlh78gHuPCqJcs_E9Q&typo=1) This would finally allow institutional entities to invest into cannabis companies, driving valuations higher.

During both of the last two industry-wide rallies, High Tide was  still a relatively unknown name. They have since achieved the top  revenue slot in Canada and have established themselves as the most  dominant business model. They are likely to garner significantly more  attention during the next major rally.

Earlier this week it was revealed that the German government [finally reached an agreement](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d8080962928%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,vLvCND6VE_x1nWOC7U90loN7BNJFbcs7Q0IRicVG8ZXIb5lfHWo8O3njo9lVZt67g10TpLRJzo1ytl9BUg-o4pXAHr4UX_7UM7GkrddS2Mnvp5mNae7E5A,,&typo=1) on establishing the rules for the regulation of cannabis in Germany. In preparation for this, High Tide has already [formed a relationship](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d0c6101fec9%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,ii71WUFasMTTGC9OYn9hvuTXsVFNk7DPyJgX-Mi8koawl4q9QRCjJqpuWjyRaNBFQqJwJ-sSX66s3LbNgvp6HaUiQMGXQ-X_WAC_sdhiAfDjLQNfxVPWuaIGZ3o,&typo=1) with Berlin-based Sanity Group to assist an expansion of their retail footprint there.

High Tide has adaptation and innovation ingrained into its DNA; they  are perpetually searching for new sources of high margin revenue. In  addition to constantly releasing additional white label products, they  have been developing a line of digital kiosks under the name Fastendr.  While they are currently using them in their storefronts to reduce labor  costs, modified versions of the technology could be leased out to other  retailers. Also, I speculate that the development of these digital  kiosks may one day lead to the release of a line of vending machines  which would be capable of checking the age of customers before a sale.  In addition to cannabis, such machines could also be able to be used for  alcohol or tobacco products.

In addition to their Cabana Club discount model, they are also  digging a very deep moat with their Elite program. Elite customers pay  an annual fee to be granted access to even deeper discounts. This model  is similar to the one Costco uses. Once a consumer pays to gain access  to such deep discounts, they are less likely to be interested in  purchasing their cannabis and accessories anywhere else. The combined  power of these two discount choices produces a recipe for building  incredibly strong brand loyalty.

With most of the industry still focused on attempting to produce  profits from growing the plant, they are all exposed to the risk of  production while High Tide is not. During periods where the price of  cannabis is high, producers can expect better margins and returns. Yet  anytime the price is low, producers can expect to struggle. Also, with  most commodities, selling it to end use customers allows for the  opportunity of a value-added experience and is far more profitable than  producing it. This is why Starbucks ([SBUX](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d87f22cc880%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,QJ9ED3NuJsdyQHrNtbBJZjTD9GNPVuZcrnYU2YEjn42wdESa2DEPNAGcPINS0rWk2hwzfT496cgjy24V6BbE3RVe1Jv0zAS8lOL1JUFT&typo=1))  produces only a tiny amount of the coffee they sell. As the industry  matures, I expect for the price of flower to continue falling. However,  shifting the thinking of an entire industry takes time. Several months  ago Bruce Linton, former CEO of Canopy Growth, was being interviewed by  The Dales Report when he expressed to them just how powerful High Tide’s  business model was. Now that Bruce has had the opportunity to step  outside the game and become an outside observer, he has altered his  beliefs on the long-term path the industry is trending toward. “Canna  Cabana and those guys, Raj gets it”

While I blame most of the suffering the growers are experiencing on  rampant overproduction, the additional downward pressure High Tide  places on the retail price of cannabis is only making their situation  worse. As time goes on, and more of their competition fails, attractive [buying opportunities](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fhightideinc.us19.list-manage.com%2ftrack%2fclick%3fu%3d3b4d266f196d54eb52c1be96e%26id%3d112a163c76%26e%3de583f5f410&c=E,1,3caVxiOVUgP1ojU8oNxnfQ4IxAmNPrBZYpP0PxcvUAx3oEw0Dag6z_i7pIZyTj8T6DMZjgjbOzOhZp7Ta_T81XOt8ekwxJEZ4-QbSLNwrMURIwltPDaKRFsHGA,,&typo=1) should continue to present themselves.

Unlike most of their competition, High Tide has an extremely low cost  of expansion. Statements made by the CEO indicate their average cost of  opening a new store is only about $300K CAD. They chose to vertically  integrate cannabis accessories instead of the cannabis itself and  already have a global supply chain in place. They merely have to secure a  local source of cannabis when they enter a new market. Everyone else’s  business model revolves around growing cannabis, so they also have to  set up growing and processing infrastructure. Producing cost of  expansion estimates for every single company in the industry is beyond  what I am willing to attempt. However, I can look at Asset Turnover  Ratio to assess, in a very rough way, everyone’s cost of expansion. I  need to be clear that Asset Turnover Ratio is ttm Revenue/Assets. It is  not New Market Revenue/Cost of Expansion. However, this does tell a  story; it is clear that High Tide requires less capital to expand than a  majority of their competition.

## Conclusions

By now, you can understand why High Tide is not just my highest  conviction cannabis play, it is my single highest conviction investment.  Choosing companies that are competitive is good, but I prefer to take  it one step further and invest into companies which have inherently  unfair business models. High Tide’s discount model is wildly popular  with consumers, while applying financial stress to their competitors;  this is perfect.

Management has already proven they are competent and understand the  needs of their customers on a higher level than their competition. When  the price war broke out in Canada, it spurred adaptation and innovation.  Everyone was forced to scramble to find new strategies for long-term  success. This company has adapted itself into one which is capable of  thriving regardless of the price of the commodity they sell. They are  thirsty to expand into new markets and can do so cheaply. With them  currently limited to only opening stores in Canada, and additional  markets becoming available to them soon, they still have an extremely  long runway.

The stock has been in an accumulation zone for the last 18 months or  so, and I will continue buying until the next major rally. Because of  their low cost of expansion and culture of innovation, I believe this  company has the potential to become a very attractive long-term  compounded
